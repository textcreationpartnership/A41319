         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THOSE that would ſet up to make a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and draw Diſciples after them, <hi>have a mighty advantage in the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> there is a ſtrong Inclination in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, to quarrel with the abſolute Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Dominion of God over his Creatures, <hi>to do with them, for his own Glory, what ſemmeth good in his ſight. Men would fain be from</hi> under <hi>the Lordſhip and Dominion of God, but it</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe it is</hi> natural to Men <hi>to think, that if they be ſaved it muſt be</hi> by their own Merits, <hi>and</hi> Worthineſs, <hi>and not from the ſpecial, and diſtinguiſhing Grace of God. And 'tis that which Arminianiſm brings Men to at laſt: For if God have not made a difference amongſt the Children of Men by his</hi> ſpecial Grace in Election, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and</hi> Regeneration <hi>then they, with what helps they had common to them that are ſaved, and to them that periſh, do</hi> make themſelves to differ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The way is prepared before them that would teach Men in the Arminian way, 'tis ſuited to Corrupt Nature. But to bring Men to own the</hi> Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God <hi>over them, to bring Men to be ſenſible of the</hi> Holineſs and Juſtice of God, <hi>to bring them to</hi> cry guilty before God, <hi>to acknowledge
<pb facs="tcp:49367:3"/>their own vileneſs, to</hi> wonder that God ſhould ſave any, <hi>who might juſtly have damned all for ſin: To ſay in their Hearts, if God take Vengeance upon them for ever, yet he is Righteous, to</hi> ſay, let me live, and I ſhall praiſe thee for ever: <hi>To wonder that God was ever manifeſt in the fleſh, and ſuffered as Mediatour, and Surety to ſave Sinners: to ſee nothing in our ſelves, not ſo much as a good thought, or good inclination, but what God puts into us. To ſee, that we cannot believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn to God, but by his giving us a</hi> new Heart, <hi>and</hi> a new Spirit; <hi>infuſing Grace into us, making us new Creatures; that if we be ſaved, when others periſh, it is from free and ſpecial Grace, that is to be adored to Eternity: I ſay, to have our Hearts brought to theſe things, is hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yea impoſſible,</hi> except God be pleaſed to touch our Hearts, and turn them with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand. <hi>He can give our Hearts</hi> a ſaving turn in a moment, <hi>eaſier than we can think a thought. His willing to do it for us, is the doing of it for us, in the way and time of his own appointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men may hold ſome Errours</hi> Notionally, and not Practically, <hi>elſe there were more danger in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm as to Eternal Salvation than Men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> 1. <hi>An Arminian, if he ſhould act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Doctrine, he</hi> can never pray to God for ſpecial Grace, <hi>that God would</hi> determine <hi>and</hi> fix his Will <hi>to himſelf, by his eſpecial Grace, that God againſt all oppoſition from corrupt nature would give a new Heart. All that an Arminian can pray for, according to that Doctrine, is, that God would propound, and urge Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to him, and that ſtill he may be left to himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:49367:3"/>what he will do, which is but</hi> mocking of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of praying unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>An Arminian, if he act according to that Doctrine,</hi> cannot thank and praiſe the Lord for ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Grace in Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Vocation; <hi>but muſt thank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he be ſaved, (when others periſh) by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that univerſal Grace, which others did not improve. There would be but</hi> cold ſinging <hi>before the Throne in Heaven to Eternity, for that Grace that brought them</hi> thither, <hi>if it were not ſpecial Grace that ſaved them, when others go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment in Hell.</hi> Let my Soul be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to that people, who have a Principle and Heart given them of God, to ſay to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be all the praiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Arminian Doctrine, whilſt it pretendeth to give great encouragement to Sinners to hope for Salvation by Chriſt, their Doctrine doth (if it were true)</hi> take away all poſſibility and hope of Salvation for any Man or Woman now living upon the face of the Earth; <hi>which I make out by theſe two particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is clear from the Scripture, that thoſe that ſhall have Eternal Salvation in Heaven</hi> are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt, and are ſanctified in part in this life, <hi>that he that dieth an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> John 3. ult. <hi>And without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is clear from the Scripture, that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> we are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, <hi>Eph</hi> 2.1. That the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:49367:4"/>indeed can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>That except God do abſolutely give a new Heart, there can be no true Faith and Holineſs in any man.</hi> The Heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 17.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, I ſay, if there be not ſuch a</hi> ſpecial love <hi>in God to</hi> ſome, <hi>whereby he will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly, againſt all oppoſition from the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, give them a new Heart, give them converting and keeping Grace, there is no poſſibility of the Salvation of any Man. Arminian univerſal Grace can never bring any Man to Heaven; it must be</hi> ſpecial, effectual, omnipotent Grace <hi>that muſt do it, or elſe all muſt periſh for ever. This Author directs his diſcourſe againſt the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>as if they only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation in the ſenſe that he oppoſeth; but I have ſhewn by the</hi> Articles <hi>of</hi> Lambeth 1595. <hi>and by the Articles of</hi> Ireland 1615. <hi>that the</hi> Epiſcopal Divines <hi>have maintained the ſame Doctrine, and that thoſe whom he calleth Presbyterians, next to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, learnt that Doctrine from the old Epiſcopal Divines. Thoſe that maintain the Doctrine of the Sovereignty, Immutability, and Omnipotency of God, may be bold to ſay what they are able on</hi> Gods behalf <hi>againſt vain man, that</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn him his way, <hi>that would dictate to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty what he ſhould do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe that maintain that Chriſt, God-man, dyed ſo effectually for all thoſe for whom he dyed, that he will certainly and infallibly bring them to Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have no cauſe to be aſhamed of their Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe that maintain that,</hi> no man can come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him, and that
<pb facs="tcp:49367:4"/>with ſuch a drawing, as that they ſhall freely, and yet moſt certainly and infallibly come to Chriſt, <hi>and be eternally ſaved, have truth on their ſide: And all the Sophiſtry Cavils and Evaſions of Arminians, are as nothing to overthrow this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Whoſoever ſhall obſerve the Book that I anſwer, will find that this Author doth ſcarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to argue and prove any thing, except it be in a</hi> very few places, <hi>but only raiſes</hi> outcries <hi>againſt others. Therefore what I have written, is only</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned <hi>by this Author to clear up theſe points, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to anſwer any Arguments he hath produced for his opinions; but that little Argument he hath uſed, I have taken into conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Reader thinks that I have now and then uſed too much</hi> ſharpneſs <hi>againſt this Author, he may be pleaſed to take notice, that thoſe that know me, can teſtifie that I have a greater Latitude as to any</hi> rigid judging <hi>of men, as to their Eternal Eſtates, becauſe they hold many erroneous opinions, than ſome others have. Thoſe that are truly built upon Chriſt, upon</hi> his Merits and Righteouſneſs <hi>as</hi> their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>though they may in their</hi> Superſtructure <hi>have much</hi> Hay and Stubble, <hi>yet God will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pardon them in Chriſt. But when this Author tramples not only upon the Aſſembly of Divines, but upon</hi> Calvin, Zuinglius, Beza, <hi>and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Reformed Churches; and extolls</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Servetus, <hi>one of the</hi> greateſt Blaſphemers of the Sacred Trinity that ever was in the World: <hi>It may be ſome Readers will think I have not been ſharp enough againſt ſuch a confident Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is printed with this Authours, a Book of Mr.</hi> Haggars, <hi>I never heard of the perſon, or of
<pb facs="tcp:49367:5"/>his Book before, though it ſeems it hath been printed five times. It may be it hath been anſwered, or none have thought it worth the anſwering.</hi>

               <hi>The Book is almoſt nothing but Errours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: I do not remember that ever I read a Book more confuſed, or where the Author ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more ignorant of the true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he makes uſe of, except it were in ſome Books of the Quakers.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Epheſ. 1.3, 4, 5. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him, before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, was laid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle there ſheweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That</hi> there are Spiritual Bleſſings beſtowed upon ſome. <hi>Theſe Spiritual Bleſſings are effectual Calling, Juſtification, Adoption, Perſeverance in Grace, and the Heavenly inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſhews that all theſe Spiritual Bleſſings are</hi> conferred upon us through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, <hi>as</hi> the Meritorious cauſe. <hi>God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do all for the Heirs of Salvation, in and through him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſhews the</hi> Eternal Deſignation of the perſons that ſhall in due time partake of theſe Spiritual Bleſſings, <hi>he ſaith they were</hi> choſen in Chriſt, before the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He ſhews that they were not choſen upon any foreſight of their Holineſs, by improving thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon helps they had equal with others; but that God</hi> choſe them that they might be Holy; <hi>that is, he would in due time give them Faith and Holineſs: And this is yet more evident from</hi> v. 5. <hi>having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
<pb facs="tcp:49367:5"/>(that is fore-ordained) us to the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to the good pleaſure of his Will: <hi>So that it is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that thoſe whom God choſe, he choſe them ſo, as that he would himſelf make them holy, and that the</hi> moving cauſe <hi>was not any worthineſs or toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them, which God foreſaw: But the Apoſtle ſaith, it was the good pleaſure of Gods will, his eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial undeſerved free Love, and good will to their perſons that was the moving cauſe of their Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now let the Reader obſerve what this Author ſaith to this Scripture:</hi> Though God calleth men elect from the Foundation of the World, yet they are not elect, until the very day of their Converſion, and turning from Sin to God, for God calleth things that are not, as if they were; From whence it is evident, they were not elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though ſo called. <hi>page</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What a ſtrange paſſage is this? As much as to ſay, though the Scripture ſaith it was ſo, yet it was not ſo well; but ſaith this Author, it is ſaid of</hi> Abraham, Rom. 4.17. As it is written, I have made thee a Father of many Nations before him, whom he believed, even God who quickens the dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were.</p>
            <p>Now ſaith this Author, Abraham <hi>was not yet a Father of many Nations, but it was ſo before God who calleth things that are not, as if they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the underſtanding of this Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerve, that though it was but at that time ſpoken of, and declared to</hi> Abraham, Gen. 17.4, 5. <hi>that he ſhould be a Father of many Nations,</hi> yet God hath made and appointed him ſo to be from Eternity. <hi>Tho' Gods Decrees and Intentions what he will do, are manifeſted to men in time, yet they are all from Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49367:6"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſerve, that when God did declare to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>his</hi> Eternal Counſel, <hi>that he ſhould be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations,</hi> Abrahams <hi>Body was</hi> dead as to Maſculine Vigour. <hi>But the Apoſtle ſhews, that nothing can hinder Gods Purpoſes and Decrees; for God quickneth the Dead, (dead</hi> Souls, <hi>and dead</hi> Bodies <hi>when he pleaſes,) and</hi> calleth things that are not, as if they were, <hi>that is, calleth for what he pleaſeth, and it is done. As in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God did but ſay,</hi> Let there be Light, and there was Light. <hi>The Apoſtle is ſhewing</hi> Gods Omnipotency: <hi>That God having appointed</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to be a Father of many Nations, nothing can hinder his eternal purpoſe, for ſaith the Apoſtle, he quickens the dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were.</hi> Ut majorem ejus rei facilitatem in deo declaret, <hi>to</hi> ſhew the great facility of this Work to God, to whom it is as eaſy to make any thing to be, as it is for us to call for a thing, and eaſier too; <hi>as one Expoſitor notes well upon the place: So that this Author quite miſtakes the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the place, for God did not tell</hi> Abraham <hi>that he was a Father of many Nations, when he was not: But God told him, that he had made him, that is, appointed him ſo to be, which ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the appointed Time and Seaſon, by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency againſt all natural impoſſibilities; becauſe he is the Almighty God that quickneth the dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were. When he calleth for any thing to be done, to be effected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſe, it exiſts the ſame moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Context in</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>with other Scriptures concerning</hi> Abraham, <hi>may give much light into this Controverſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Terah</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49367:6"/>himſelf were at firſt Idolaters, <hi>and</hi> ſerved other Gods, Joſhua 24.2, 3. <hi>Yet</hi> Abraham <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon that God had choſen to Salvation from Eternity, he was called, and converted in the Lords appointed time, though he was ſuch an unlikely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to obtain Mercy,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As the Lord had from Eternity choſen</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>to be</hi> a Veſſel of Mercy, <hi>ſo he had</hi> alſo made, appointed, and decreed from Eternity, that he ſhould be a Father of many Nations, <hi>and</hi> that of him as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt ſhould come, <hi>and nothing could hinder Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being fulfilled in its Seaſon, becauſe God is Omnipotent, he quickens the dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were. From whence we may gather, that whatſoever God hath graciouſly purpoſed to do for any, he will</hi> certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly perform <hi>it againſt all</hi> Natural and Moral Impoſſibilities, <hi>for he quickneth the Dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were. When he pleaſes to call any thing to exiſt, and be, by the word of his power, it doth certainly and infallibly exiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Text that this Author bringeth to prove, that</hi> a thing may be ſaid to be done, when it is not done, <hi>is Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>and</hi> all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall Worſhip him, (the Beaſt) whoſe names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which he ſaith,</hi> Chriſt is called the Lamb ſlain <hi>from</hi> the Foundation of the World, tho' he was not ſlain many thouſand years after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer, Chriſt was ſlain in God's Decree and Purpoſe, from Eternity; he was</hi> fore-ordained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:49367:7"/>the Foundation of the World, <hi>to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>fore-ordained to be crucified and ſlain, as the Sacrifice for the Sins of the Elect,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. But we ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden Myſtery which God ordained before the World, unto our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>This manifold Wiſdom of God, and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Riches of his Grace, in ſaving the Elect by the Blood of his Son, was ordained before the World was made, and conſequently from Eternity, Prov.</hi> 8.23. I was ſet up from Everlaſting, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or ever the Earth was. <hi>V.</hi> 30, 31. Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his Delight, rejoycing always before him, rejoycing in the habitable parts of his Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In theſe Words, Chriſt, the</hi> Eſſential Wiſdom of God, <hi>doth declare, not only that he was from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> as the Son of God, <hi>but that he was alſo ſet up from Everlaſting,</hi> as Mediator; <hi>that he was appointed to be incarnate, to take upon him Humane Nature in Time, and to be ſlain for the Redemption of his People that were given unto him of the Father; and upon the</hi> proſpect <hi>of this he ſaith,</hi> his delight was with the Sons of Men: <hi>He rejoyced in the Thoughts of his redeeming the Children that were given him. It was upon the account of the Decree, that Christ was to take upon him Humane Nature, and die for his Church; that as ſoon as ever Man fell, it was declared that there ſhould come one that ſhould</hi> bruiſe the Serpent's Head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And upon the account of this Decree it was, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Old Teſtament did</hi> really partake <hi>of the Vertue of Christ's Death, as if he had been
<pb facs="tcp:49367:7"/>ſlain; and to encourage their Faith, Christ was</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically ſlain <hi>in their bloody Sacrifices, before he came in the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that this Text is nothing to this Author's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but if it be rightly underſtood, gives much light againſt the Arminian Doctrine: It ſhews that God decreed Chriſt's Death from Eternity: Ay, It was not only decreed from Eternity, that the Son of God ſhould take upon him the Nature of Man in Time; but it was decreed from Eternity, that he ſhould take that particular Body, and not another; that</hi> holy Thing <hi>that was conceived miraculouſly in the Womb of the bleſſed Virgin; that That holy Thing ſhould be taken into perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with his Godhead, and that at the ſet Time which God's Council from Eternity had determined it ſhould be done, he ſhould then be crucified and ſlain, to make an end of Sin, and bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Author ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh between</hi> God's Decrees, <hi>and</hi> the Execution of them. <hi>All God's Decrees and Purpoſes what he would do, in making the World, Angels and Men, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of things for his own Glory, were from Eternity: The Execution of his Decrees are in Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Arminians holding that Christ died for all</hi> Adam's <hi>Poſterity, are wonderfully confounded with this Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Chriſt died for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, then ſurely God would ſo order it in his Providence, that all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſhould have Chriſt preached to them, and have the outward Means to come to the Knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this Objection ſome of them ſay, that the Sun, Moon and Stars, and other Works of Creation preach Christ, though but darkly.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ay, but this Author ſaith,</hi> pag. 10.

            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer, Theſe Words tend to the</hi> Subverſion of true Religion. <hi>The Heathens, by Tradition from the</hi> Jews, <hi>took up a way of Sacrifices; but the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God. <hi>What though the Gentiles do know there is a God, and this leaves them without Excuſe for their groſs Idolatry, in changing the Glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God into the Image of corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping Things?</hi> Rom. 1.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>What if the Heathen by natural Conſcience do think that God is offended? And what if they have, by Tradition from the Jews, taken up a way of offering Sacrifices to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe a Deity? Still they have no ſufficient Light, and Means of Salvation, becauſe they do not know Christ the Mediator, the only true Sacrifice for Sin. All the Sacrifices they offer are an Abomination to the Lord, and make them more abominable unto him.</hi>

            <p>THE Perſon with whom I have now to do, calls his Book, <hi>A Dialogue between the Baptiſt and the Presbyterian;</hi> and ſtileth himſelf <hi>Meſſenger of the Baptized Churches in</hi> Lincolnſhire. It is fit to enquire a little into theſe two Titles he giveth himſelf. He ſtileth himſelf <hi>the Baptiſt.</hi> Indeed, we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>In thoſe days came</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſs of</hi> Judea, <hi>and ſaying, Repens ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; and this is he that was ſpoken of by the Prophet</hi> Eſaias, <hi>ſaying, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> So we read of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> that was propheſied of by <hi>Eſaias,</hi> who is <hi>already come:</hi> but I find no Prophecy of any <hi>Thomas the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> that was to be ſent of God. John <hi>is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Baptiſt,</hi> becauſe he Baptized Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and becauſe he was ſent in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to Baptize the people of the <hi>Jews.</hi> I think it is too high a Title for any man now living in the World to call himſelf the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Author ſtiles himſelf <hi>Meſſenger of the Baptized Churches in</hi> Lincolnſhire. I ſuppoſe, that all the Churches and Congregations in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49367:11"/>of all perſwaſions, do think, that the Members of their Churches are Baptized, tho' not in this Author's way, and is he the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of them all? But take it for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his own Perſwaſion. Let us enquire how he is their Meſſenger. <hi>We read of Meſſengers of the Churches,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23.24. <hi>Whether any do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of</hi> Titus, <hi>he is my partner and fellow-helper: or our Brethren be enquired of, they are the Meſſengers of the Churches, and the glory of Chriſt. Wherefore ſhew ye to them, and before the Churches, the proof of your Love, and of our boaſting on your behalf.</hi> As for the Meſſengers of the Churches here ſpoken of, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> they were only choſen by ſome Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to travel up and down to other Churches for a ſhort ſpace, to get Contribution and Relief for other Churches, that were in great want by being ſpoiled of their Goods by Perſecutors, or by ſome other means brought to ſome great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward neceſſities. And if this Author be a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Churches in that way, he hath undertaken a good work; and I hope, that thoſe he is ſo violent againſt, will be as Charitable to relieve the neceſſities of other Chriſtians, though not of their Perſwaſion, as he can expect. But when he calleth himſelf Meſſenger of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Churches in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> he hath another meaning. We read of the <hi>Angels of the ſeven Churches,</hi> Rev. 1.20. Now by the Angels of thoſe Churches, is meant, Meſſengers of the Lord to thoſe Churches: The Lord's Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to declare his Mind and Will to them. Here were ſeveral Angels and Meſſengers of the Seven Churches; but one Man was not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Meſſenger of ſeveral Churches. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49367:11"/>Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was not the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and of the reſt of the Seven Churches. So that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this Author counteth himſelf to have Juriſdiction and Authority over many Churches. And truly if he be <hi>the Baptiſt, a Title given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to</hi> John <hi>hitherto,</hi> and be Meſſenger at the ſame time, of ſeveral Churches, we know not how many, and have Spiritual Power over them, he is an extraordinary perſon, and 'tis no wonder that he deals with ſo many perſons and things. Yet truly, I ſhould think, if he were more than an ordinary Presbyter, he ſhould viſit with more Mildneſs and Moderation.</p>
            <p>There is another thing in the Title Page that is very bold and daring to the moſt high God. He repreſents the Presbyterians as holding Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Soul-devouring Doctrines, making God the ordainer of all the Sins of Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and reprobating the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind without any help of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning God's ordaining of all the ſins of Men and Devils, I ſhall ſpeak (God willing) in anſwer to your Book, and ſhew in what Senſe God ordained and decreed to leave Angels and Men to themſelves, and ſo to ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As to Reprobating the greateſt part of mankind, without any help of Salvation; this you call, A Cruel and Soul-devouring Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. That I ſuppoſe your ſelf hold, that the greateſt part of mankind do in the end periſh eternally. I am ſure our Saviour declared, that <hi>few</hi> there be that find the ſtrait gate and narrow way to Heaven. That 'tis but <hi>a little Flock to whom God gives the Kingdom of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49367:12"/>Heaven.</hi> That tho' <hi>many are called, yet few are choſen.</hi> Not but thoſe that are ſaved, are a Multitude which no Man can number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. yet comparatively they are few; they are few in compariſon of thoſe that periſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether they that periſh were ordained of old from Eternity to Condemnation for their ſins; or reprobated in time, as you hold: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this little alters the caſe. As for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mankind, reprobated they are, and caſt into Hell at laſt, without any help, or hope of Salvation; and if this be cruel Doctrine, have a care that you don't contend and ſtrive with the holy Sovereignty and Juſtice of God; and when you argue with men about theſe things, have a care you don't quarrel with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Do you think that thoſe that do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the incomprehenſible Greatneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God can ever be ſatisfied that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes mens temporary ſinning with Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. 'Tis not talking of a common love of God to mankind, and talking of Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, when in the Concluſion God takes Vengeance for ever upon ſo many of mankind for their Sin and Folly: That will really take off men from quarrelling with God: But the humble acknowledgment of his abſolute Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over the Works of his Hands; and that he is infinitely Juſt and Righteous in all that he doth; tho' we, poor Duſt and Aſhes, cannot comprehend it: This muſt ſilence Man.</p>
            <p>This Author ſets down a Scripture in the Title Page, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 64.7, 8, 9. <hi>But God ſhall ſhoot at them with an Arrow; ſuddenly ſhall they be wounded, ſo they ſhall make their own Tongue to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49367:12"/>fall upon themſelves:</hi> This is to reflect upon the Presbyterians, who, he had ſaid before, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by their own Pens. I pray God that you, as well as others, may not be puniſhed for your Pen, for your Writings. Lord enter not into Judgment with any of us; but pardon us for Chriſt's ſake. And as to thoſe words you quote, <hi>God ſhall ſhoot at them, ſuddenly ſhall they be wounded:</hi> How do you apply theſe words to the Presbyterians, againſt whom you write? They hope to be pardoned and ſaved by the Free Grace of God in Chriſt. God might ſhoot at them, and you with an Arrow. Let us have a care of being proud Phariſees. And truly you ſeem to ſhoot your Arrow againſt the Sovereignty of the God of Heaven, have a care it doth not fall upon your own Head. You do, as it were, arraign God at your Bar, about his Lordſhip over the Creature; and he muſt do ſo and ſo, or elſe he is not Juſt. Repent, and turn to God, leſt he arraign you at his Bar-Tremble at this word, at this Scripture you have ſet down. And for making mens Tongues fall upon themſelves, let us all fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thoſe upon whom God is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch Grace, as that they ſay from their Hearts, that they do not ſtand upon terms with God; but acknowledge God might have had no thoughts of Eternal Love to them; but might have decreed to leave them to their ſins, and to glorifie his Juſtice upon them for ever: and that if it had not been for ſpecial diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Grace, they had never come to Chriſt; tho' they had thoſe common helps that others think are ſufficient. I ſay, theſe are not ſo like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49367:13"/>to have their Tongues fall upon themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, as thoſe that ſay, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing that God freely decreed as to their particular perſons; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing Chriſt did for them in Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Holy Ghoſt in working upon their Hearts, they might have been damned; but their own Will had the Caſting-Voice, and was ſo towardly, that they ſhall be ſaved. When thoſe that God on his part did every way as much, as for them, do periſh in Hell for ever.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. <hi>A Vindication of Dr.</hi> Collings, <hi>from the Errour that this Author charges upon him.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Author of this Dialogue viſiting theſe Parts, firſt wrote a Contentious Letter to Mr. <hi>B. K.</hi> Then next he falls upon that Learned and Pious Divine, Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> who is now at reſt with the Lord. Tho' the Dr. was dead, yet this Author muſt print what had paſſed about this Controverſie: And tho' the Ignorant and Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous may think, he hath done great matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. yet he hath done nothing at all: Yea, this Author gives up the Cauſe to the Dr. in his ſecond Letter, in theſe words, <hi>Page</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You cannot fairly collect from my Paper that God can be reſiſted in the thing wherein he will act Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotently, for then he ſhould ceaſe to be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is the very thing that the Dr. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49367:13"/>in his Book, and in his Anſwer to this Author's Letter: So that this Author's Tongue hath fallen upon himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115.3. <hi>Our God is in the Heavens; he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed.</hi> Iſa. 46.10. <hi>My Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my Pleaſure.</hi> When any ſay that God acts Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potently in this, or that which he purpoſes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do, I ſuppoſe, none have ſuch groſs concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, as to think that God is hardly put to it to effect any thing that he pleaſes to do. When we read of God's Right-hand, and the exceeding greatneſs of his Power in ſome Acts of God, 'tis only to ſhew the greatneſs of thoſe Works above ſome other Works of God; but not at all to ſhew that God is hardly put to it to do thoſe Works. It is as eaſie for God, who is Omnipotent, to do the greateſt Work that he pleaſes to do, as to do the leaſt Works he pleaſes to do. He doth all things that he pleaſes to do with the greateſt facility. He made the World with the word of his Power: He upholds it as long as he pleaſes with the word of his Power: He converts Souls by the word of his Power: He raiſes the dead by the word of his Power: His willing in this ſenſe, is his effecting what he Wills: He doth whatſoever he pleaſes to do, as eaſily, and more eaſily than we can ſpeak a word.</p>
            <p>But ſtill I fear, this Author doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he ſaith, and what others ſay in this matter; for if he had, he would have done with this Contention.</p>
            <p>For he adds, <hi>Doth God never act Seriouſly when he doth not act Omnipotently?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, As for ſuch a phraſe as God acting Seriouſly, I do not love to uſe it. It ſeems to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49367:14"/>me, that tho' we uſe ſuch an expreſſion as to Men, yet I think it is below the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and the Dr. uſing that word in his Book, you catch at it; and it is all the advantage you have againſt him. What Man upon Earth, not infallibly inſpired, but may ſometimes uſe a word that may not be ſo proper; but for that which the Dr. intended in that expreſſion in his Book, and explained in his Letter, it will ſtand againſt you and all the World. That is, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the great and glorious God hath purpoſed, and intended he will do, ſhall certainly be effected by his glorious Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which this Author does not underſtand, which would ſet his Judgment right in this Controverſie, is this; There are Laws, Precepts, and Commands of God, whereby he ſhews what is <hi>our duty to do:</hi> This we may call the Will of God, in reſpect of Precepts and Commands to us, what we ought to do: But then the Will of God is often taken in another ſenſe <hi>for his Eternal Purpoſe, what he will do in us, for us, and with us:</hi> and this is always effected in the time appointed by him. God's Will in reſpect of his Precepts or Commands, is, that none ſhould ſin at all: but God did not purpoſe to keep every one from ſinning; no, he did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to keep the Elect from all ſin after their Converſion: in this life, ſo far as God purpoſed to reſtrain ſin in any, he doth effect it. Tho' the Creatures don't do what he commands them to do, yet he always doth effect, and doth whatſoever he purpoſes to do in them, for them, or with them.</p>
            <p>How the Dr. quoting thoſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49367:14"/>
               <hi>For who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> You make thoſe words to be the words of ſome Caviller and Objector, and you ſay, that the Dr. and you have reſiſted God's Will.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The Apoſtle had ſaid in the verſe before, <hi>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardeneth.</hi> Now let it be ſo, that the whole of the 19th Verſe, is the Allegation of one that objects againſt God's giving Grace, or denying Grace to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, as he pleaſes: Yet obſerve, tho' the Apoſtle in the following words anſwereth to the beginning of the 19th. Verſe, <hi>Why doth he yet find fault?</hi> The Apoſtle doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as you have done, but, <hi>O vain Man!</hi> (O proud Clay) <hi>ſhall not the Potter have power over the Clay, to make of the ſame lump, one Veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> So confirming what he had ſaid, that <hi>God hath mercy upon whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Verſ. 18. If then the latter part of the 19th. Verſe, be the words of a Caviller, or Objector againſt God's Sovereignty, in giving or denying his Grace to whom he will, <hi>the Apoſtle acknowledges that to be a truth, Who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> In his everlaſting Decrees and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: But to take the meaning of the words as you do, who hath reſiſted his Will? I ſay, taking it for the Will of God in reſpect of his Precepts and Commands to Men: Every one knows they had reſiſted God's Will in that ſenſe; that is, broken his Commands: and if that were the meaning of, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> the Apoſtle would have made anſwer, all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49367:15"/>God: and not, O man, who art thou that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? He aſſerts the Sovereignty, Lordſhip, and Dominion of God over the Creatures; and ſo he goes on, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22, 23. The Apoſtle by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God knew how to anſwer him that finds fault with God about his Decrees: He ſhews the abſolute Power and Lordſhip of God, that he may ſave one by his Grace, and condemn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Sins, as he pleaſes; and that it is not for Man to diſpute and contend with God as many do.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay to the Doctor, <hi>you ſeem to hold that God cannot affect an end, (I ſuppoſe you mean he cannot convert a Sinner) without a willing the utmoſt of his power to effect it. But you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give an inſtance where he ever did exert, or put forth his power to the utmoſt in any thing that ever he did. We muſt take heed, leſt we limit the power of the Almighty; leſt whilſt we accuſe others, we our ſelves be found moſt ignorant of Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, all this is againſt your ſelf, for ſeeing Gods power is infinite, and his greatneſs is unſearchable: Therefore he doth effect, and bring to paſs whatſoever he wills and pleaſes to do, in the converſion of any Man he pleaſes to Convert, or in any other thing that it is his Will and Pleaſure to effect and do. When the Doctor ſaith, <hi>when God affects an end (that is, purpoſes to bring a thing to paſs,) he muſt needs put forth the utmoſt of his power to effect it:</hi> The plain meaning is, not that God in any Act of his puts forth all his power: But ſo much power,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49367:15"/>as to effect and bring to paſs infallibly what he purpoſed, and intended to do: And that when it is the Lords Gracious purpoſe and intention to Convert a Soul, he doth exert, and put forth his power, ſo as that the Soul ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly be Converted.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>you cannot give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance where God did ever exert and put forth his power to the utmoſt in any thing that ever he did,</hi> this makes for the Doctors poſition; for it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, if there were a thouſand thouſand times more oppoſition and difficulty in the Converting of a Man, or in any other thing that he pleaſes to do, yet nothing is too hard: Yea, all is eaſy for God to do, if it pleaſes him to do it. <hi>I think you have been over-ruled by the All-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God to juſtifie the Doctor, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your ſelf with your own pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your fourth Paragraph runs all upon the old miſtake, that you do not diſtinguiſh between the will of God, in reſpect of his precepts which he commands us as our Duty, and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intention what he will do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which the Doctor puts you to prove, is this, that God willed within himſelf the Converſion of the old World, the Jews and Phariſees that never were Converted: That is, whether God decreed purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and intended to Convert thoſe of the old World, thoſe of the Jews and Phriaſees, or any other perſon</hi> that never are Converted. You endeavour to prove that God did ſo will and purpoſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You ſay as to the old World, that God was ſo ſerious and inwardly concerned, that he ſtrove with them by his Spirit, and it grieved him at the Heart,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49367:16"/>that they were Diſobedient, and he gave them an hundred years to repent in, and this ſhews he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly willed their Repentance.</hi> I <hi>am ſure that if they had Repented, God would not have deſtroyed them; for he hath taught us ſo to judge of his threatnings to a Sinful Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. <hi>God is ſaid to ſtrive with the old World.</hi> How did he ſtrive with thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? The Lord did reprove them by the preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> for their Sins, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Conſcience; but is this enough to Convert men? if God had purpoſed and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave them, ſurely he would have done more for them: He would have given them a new Heart, and a new Spirit, he would have taken away the Heart of Stone, and given them an Heart of Fleſh. This expreſſion of Gods ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Man, muſt not be ſtrained: Surely God is greater than Man, and can prevail over the moſt Stubborn and Rebellious Heart in the World, and give it a ſaving turn in one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay it grieved God at his Heart that they were Diſobedient: It is ſaid indeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. And it repented the Lord that he had made man, and it grieved him at his Heart: This is ſpoken by a Figure called <hi>Anthropopathia.</hi> In another place it is ſaid, God is not as Man, that he ſhould repent When God is ſaid to repent or grieve, 'tis ſpoken by a Figure, and muſt not be properly taken, and ſo likewiſe, when God is ſaid to have Eyes, Hands, Face, if we be not careful to underſtand theſe things aright, we ſhall mightily diſhonour God. So that theſe things are ſpoken after the manner of Men, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49367:16"/>condeſcention to us Poor, Weak, Shallow, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but muſt be careful to underſtand them, ſo as to conſiſt with the immutability and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God. We muſt not have ſuch low thoughts of the Majeſty of God, as to think that God ever had, or can have Perturbation or Sorrow at any thing, <hi>for that is inconſiſtent with his inſinite Happineſs and Perfection:</hi> But this expreſſion of Gods repenting that he had made Man, and that it grieved him at the Heart, is <hi>only to ſet forth the extream, extraordinary wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the old World, not the leaſt perturbation and ſorrow in God, for he is infinitely above ſuch things:</hi> Ah! What need of Humility and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for guidance for the underſtanding of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſay that <hi>God gave them a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and an bundred years ſpace to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, if they had had a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Preachers of Righteouſneſs as good as <hi>Noah</hi> was, and better, and had not only a hundred years ſpace to repent in, but had had never ſo many thouſand of years, <hi>this was not enough to Convert one of them, without Gods ſpecial Grace working a new Heart in them,</hi> and as to <hi>Noah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was as bad by nature as the reſt: <hi>But</hi> Noah <hi>found Grace in the ſight of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 6.8. not only to preſerve him and his Family when the Floud came; but <hi>Noah</hi> found Grace in the ſight of the Lord, to make him a real Saint, and to be Righteous before God in that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If the reſt had found Grace in the ſight of the Lord, they had been turned to God too.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49367:17"/>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>You add that you are ſure if they had Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God would not have deſiroyed them; for he hath taught us ſo to judge of his threatnings to a ſinful Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer that Repentance is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is ſuch a Repentance as</hi> Ahab <hi>had:</hi> A change of mens Thoughts and Converſations meerly out of ſlaviſh fear of outward Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, or of Hell hereafter; and upon ſuch Repentance God may pleaſe, God doth pleaſe ſometimes to defer outward Judgments, and to beſtow outward Mercies, and when it is ſo, God purpoſed to give ſuch Repentance in order to that end, for we muſt by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that there can be any new immanent Acts in God, any new purpoſes and intentions in him with whom there is no variableneſs: There is no mutability in the Divine Majeſty, from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is ſaving Repentance, or Repentance to Salvation,</hi> ſuch as Gods Children have given them, when God takes away the Heart of Stone, and gives them an Heart of Fleſh, that is, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, accompanied with Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on Gods free Mercy in Chriſt, for pardon of Sin, and deſire and endeavour to walk ſo as to pleaſe God, to be ſure ſuch ſhall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the World to come, though they ſuffer in common Calamities here in this World.</p>
            <p>There is a Connexion between true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Salvation, not for any Merit in our Repentance: But ſo hath the Lord in infinite Wiſdom ordained from Eternity, and hath in time manifeſted it in his word, that thoſe that he is pleaſed to beſtow glory upon hereafter,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49367:17"/>he beſtows upon him them the beginnings of of grace here, <hi>both were intended eternally to their particular perſons, and from his meer good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and the exceeding Riches of his Grace. Thoſe that God had a purpoſe of grace to from Eternity, them <hi>he calls in time, according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them he hath alſo called,</hi> v. 30. 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our Works; but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began.</hi> Others beſides the elect, are called by the Preaching of the Word, yea, and may have inlightning and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Spirit, and God hath Wiſe and Holy ends in it:</p>
            <p>To Reſtrain ſome of them from being Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Church, and to reſtrain them from groſs Idolatry, and ſuch like Sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are leſs puniſhed in Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That his elect may adore for ever his Free, Special and Diſcriminating Grace, that they ſhould be ſavingly Converted, when ſome that lived under the ſame outward means of Grace, and ſome of them had great Convictions and Enlightning too, and exceeded many of them, it may be in notional knowledge, and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the Spirit: And yet they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly turned to God, when others are never ſo changed: Many other Holy ends might be mentioned, why God affordeth the Preaching of the Word to many, upon whom he never purpoſed, and intended to beſtow ſpecial and ſaving Grace. But to the Elect, God gives ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace; and this the Apoſtle ſaith, is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49367:18"/>to their works, that is, not for any worthineſs or towardlineſs in them above others, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace, which was given them in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began: That is, was promiſed them to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption between the Father and the Son from Eternity: For which purpoſe and Grace, they ſhall be enabled to praiſe God to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then you come to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>ſay to the Doctor, is it poſſible you ſhould call in queſtion Gods Seriouſneſs to the</hi> Jews? <hi>Did not God ſay to them,</hi> Pſal. 81.13. <hi>O that they had hearkned unto me, and that</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my ways! With</hi> v. 8. and 10.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as to God's Seriouſneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serious, I told you before, I do not like that ſuch words ſhould be uſed, when we ſpeak of the moſt high God: but that <hi>which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor put you to prove, is, that God purpoſed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Convert thoſe</hi> Jews <hi>that in the Concluſion were not Converted.</hi> As for theſe words, <hi>O that they had hearkened unto me! and that</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my ways!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some obſerve, that the words that we tranſlate <hi>[O that]</hi> might be rendered <hi>[O if]</hi> ſo they are rendred by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the <hi>Targum;</hi> and ſo they only ſhew the iſſue of their Obedience, if they had obeyed the Law of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This is ſpoken of</hi> Iſrael <hi>only; what is that to all mankind?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had ſome peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as to being preſerved in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and to give them plenty of outward things, if they continued to worſhip the True-God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49367:18"/>and obſerve his Ordinances, tho' but in an outward way, tho without Spirituality and Sincerity. God had ſaid to them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>There ſhall be no ſtrange God in thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou worſhip any ſtrange God:</hi> But they fell to Idolatry and ſo <hi>forfeited God's protection to them in the Land of</hi> Canaan, and ſo the Lord ſhews, that if they had hearkened unto him, to have no ſtrange Gods, and to walk in his ways tho', as I ſaid, but formally and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) <hi>God would ſoon have ſubdued their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> Verſ. 14. and the Lord ſaith, <hi>he would have fed them with the fineſt of the Wheat, and with Honey out of the Rock would he have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them,</hi> Verſ. 16. So that this place ſpeaks of Temporal Bleſſings only. Nothing of God's Intention and Pleaſure to give Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all that People, and ſo is nothing to the purpoſe. See what is ſaid of the generality of that People of the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 29.2, 3, 4. <hi>God hath not given you a Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear unto this day.</hi> No doubt God gave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Elect amongſt them, a new Heart; but as to the generality of the People, God did not give them Hearts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, which he doth infallibly give to them, to whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and intended to do it for them. <hi>No Text of Scripture muſt be underſtood ſo as to make God Impotent inſtead of Omnipotent, which he ſhould be if he could be diſappointed in bringing to paſs what he hath purpoſed and intended to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay that Chriſt was inwardly ſerious in his endeavours to gather <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> appears by his words and tears which are ſuch as may break a Heart of Stone.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49367:19"/>
            <p>I anſwer, The Texts, tho' you don't ſet them down, are <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42, 43, 44. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, if thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt, in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes; for the days ſhall come upon thee that thine Enemies ſhall caſt a trench about thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that our Saviour is not ſpeaking about the Eternal Damnation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the Temporal Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which came upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty years after. It was ſuch a Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as never was, according as our Saviour had foretold. But obſerve, notwithſtanding the Deſtruction that came upon that People, all the Elect amongſt them were Converted; and between this Prophecy, and Threatning, and the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there was a great and famous Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as we may ſee in the <hi>Acts:</hi> So that our Saviour doth not mean, that the things that belonged to their Spiritual and Eternal Peace, were hid from all the People of the Jews; for many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and were ſaved after this time: but that the things that belonged to the outward peace and ſafety of their City and Land, were now ſo hid from the Eyes of the generality of that People, and that God would lay their City and Land waſte in a ſhort ſpace.</p>
            <p>And for that place, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.37. O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49367:19"/>as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not! behold your Houſe is left unto you deſolate:</hi> and in the next Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. he ſhews what Deſolation ſhould come upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, You have had many Prophets before, that called you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and you have ſtoned, and killed them, and how often would I have gathered you for your ſafety, to prevent your Ruin by the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, that will as eaſily kill and deſtroy you, as the Eagle doth the Chickens, and ye would not.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, as he was God, ſo he was Man; <hi>and ſome Speeches and Actions belong to him as Man. Chriſt as Man preached to the</hi> Jews <hi>as a Miniſter of the Circumciſion:</hi> He was a Miniſter and Prophet to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>would have gathered them as Man, whom he would not gather as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mediator.</hi> Surely as God he could have gathered them, ſo as to prevent both their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal Deſtruction, if he had pleaſed; and as God-man Mediator he did gather the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect amongſt them as to Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>And for what you ſay concerning Chriſt's Tears over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuch as may break a Heart of Stone:</p>
            <p>I pray conſider, this may give more light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this whole buſineſs; that <hi>this is ſpoken of Chriſt only as he was man, and not as he was God:</hi> And ſo it is ſaid when Chriſt went to <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Grave, <hi>Jeſus wept,</hi> John 11.36. Surely when Chriſt wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and over <hi>Lazarus, it was only as man, he did not weep as he was Gods</hi> As he was Man he had ſuch ſinleſs Paſſions as Humane Nature hath; <hi>but as he was God he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49367:20"/>was above all weeping and ſorrow whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when you ſay that Chriſt's Tears over <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> were ſuch as might break a Heart of Stone: you muſt know, that Chriſt's pouring out of Tears as Man, is not ſufficient to break an Heart of Stone. It is only Chriſt pouring out of his Spirit upon us, as he is God-man Mediator, that can break an Heart of Stone: So that you have done nothing to prove, that when God doth graciouſly purpoſe and intend to convert a Man, that he doth not effect it.</p>
            <p>Ay, but you add, that ſure you are, that God's Mind in ſending Chriſt to them, was to turn every one of them from their Iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us enquire into the meaning of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Peter</hi> preaching to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant made with our Fathers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> Abraham, <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the kindreds of the Earth be bleſſed: unto you firſt God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was now preaching to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and tells them, that they had been ſo wicked, as to deliver up Chriſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and had killed the Prince of Life, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15. yet he exhorts them to Repent, and be Converted that their ſins might be blotted out, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. Now whereas thoſe that were Convinced, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their other ſins, they had been guilty of Crucifying the Lord of Glory, they might think there was no hope for their Salvation. He tells them, that they were the Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49367:20"/>to whom God promiſed, that by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who came of his Seed, according to the Fleſh, all the Kindreds of the Earth; all the Elect amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould be eternally bleſſed: Therefore, tho' theſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be greatly humbled for their having a hand in Chriſt's death, yet <hi>they ſhould not deſpair of Mercy:</hi> For unto you firſt God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, hath ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his Iniquities; that is, that they ſhould obtain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, be bleſſed, and ſaved, any one, every one of theſe <hi>Jews</hi> to whom <hi>Peter</hi> preached, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the evil that they had done, if now the Lord were pleaſed to give them a Heart to believe in Chriſt, whom they had Crucified. The <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding they had Crucified Chriſt, were to have a priority in having Chriſt preached to them, and Salvation by him. This is all that is intended in the words. It was far from <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning, that God purpoſed to ſave every particular man and woman of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation then living, and to turn them from their Iniquities, for then it ſhould have been effected, for the Counſel of the Lord ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſure, and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations. What do men mean in wreſting Texts of Scripture, thus to diſhonour the moſt high God, as if he were uncertain to effect what he purpoſes, and intends to do, as if he were like Man, whoſe Purpoſes are often broken off and diſappointed: No, our God is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Counſel, and mighty in working; his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As to this of the <hi>Jews,</hi> compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49367:21"/>with Scripture, and you will find, that God never ſent Chriſt to ſave and convert all the <hi>Jews, Iſaiah</hi> 8.14, 15. 'Tis a Prophecy of Chriſt, and <hi>he ſhall be for Sanctuary</hi> (to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect amongſt them) <hi>but for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houſes of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>(to the generality and Body of the</hi> Jews) <hi>for a gin and for a ſnare to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>and many amongſt them ſhall fall, and be broken, and be ſnared, and taken.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.8. after he had ſaid that Chriſt was precious to thoſe that believe, he adds, and <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence to them that ſtumble at the Word, being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were appointed:</hi> And <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34. <hi>Behold this Child is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and for a ſign that ſhall be ſpoken againſt.</hi> And when the Diſciples ſaid unto Jeſus, why ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou to them in Parables? he anſwered and ſaid unto them, Becauſe <hi>it is given unto you to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given,</hi> Matt. 13.10.11. and Luke 8.10. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given to know the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom, but to others in Parables; that ſeeing they might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand.</hi> 'Tis ſaid too in another place, when they were alone he expounded all things to his Diſciples; yea (tho' others are ready to diſpute, and quarrel with God about it) when <hi>Chorazin, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not: <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt bid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes, even
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49367:21"/>ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Matth. 11.25, 26. Theſe Scriptures make it plain, that God never purpoſed nor intended to convert and ſave the generality of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but only them, whom he had ordained unto Life Eternal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You ſay, as to the Phariſees, God did by his Servant <hi>John</hi> ſeriouſly call them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: yea, his Counſel was of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29. who never ſaid to the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye my Face in vain.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as to that place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29.30. the words are, <hi>And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans, juſtified God, being Baptiſed with the Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>but the Pariſees and Lawyers rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Baptiſed of him:</hi> For the underſtanding of this Scripture obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by this. That the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were Baptized of <hi>John, they juſtified God?</hi> the meaning is, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that God had ſent them a great Prophet to call them to Repentance, and they ſubmitted to the Ordinance of Baptiſm that he was ſent to adminiſter, <hi>not that the generality of the people that were Baptized of</hi> John, <hi>were truly converted;</hi> for <hi>John</hi>'s Preaching and Baptiſm came to little: for when he carried them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Preaching, to ſet forth, that Jeſus was the Meſſiah, the Saviour that was to come into the World, they would not own him to be the Chriſt. Indeed <hi>John</hi> was a burning and ſhining light, and for a ſeaſon the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in his light; but the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not believe that Jeſus was the Chriſt:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49367:22"/>But tho' ſome of them did admire him for his Miracles and Preaching for a while, yet the Phariſees, at the laſt, did carry it with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and they cryed out, <hi>Let him be Crucified;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>His Blood be upon us, and on our Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>what is meant by the Phariſees and Lawyers rejecting the Counſel of God against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not being Baptized of him.</hi> The meaning is, that they wholly rejected <hi>the Command of God</hi> by his Servant <hi>John; they did not ſo much as make a ſhew of Repentance, nor were Baptized of him, as many of the common people were;</hi> nor would own at all, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> preached he was. What is all this to prove, that God purpoſed and intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe Phariſees, and yet they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. As for thoſe words you mention, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſai.</hi> 45.19. <hi>He hath not ſaid to the Houſe of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain:</hi> 'Tis certain, that never any <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> that ever did ſeek God with all their Heart, diligently and ſincerely in Chriſt the Mediator, that ever it was in vain: But <hi>you are quite off from the buſineſs in hand, which is to prove, that God doth purpoſe and intend to give any perſons Hearts to ſeek him aright in Chriſt, and that God fails in the effecting and doing of it.</hi> Then you conclude your Letter to the Dr. that Miniſters, may boldly aſſure poor Souls, that God wills not their death, but that they turn and live; yea, he hath ſworn, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak a little of this; Preachers had need have a care that they ſpeak right things of God.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49367:22"/>
            <p n="1">1. As to aſſuring men that God wills not their death, <hi>take it as to particular perſons; take any man that is yet in his Sins, how can you tell him, and aſſure him, that God wills not his death?</hi> Hath not the Lord ſaid, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die?</hi> and <hi>curſed is every one that continueth not in every thing that is written in the Book of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. ſo that all men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law. Well, come to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the way of the Goſpel, <hi>if God do not give them Faith and Repentance, God wills their death and damnation;</hi> for none can be damned but thoſe whoſe Damnation God wills, to glorifie his Juſtice. <hi>God wills the Salvation of all that are ſaved, and he wills the Death and Damnation of all that are damned:</hi> Surely, you hold, that God wills the death of thoſe that are never converted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As to aſſuring men, that God wills that they turn and live:</hi> take it in this ſenſe, that where the Goſpel is preached, God commands men to turn unto him and live; and that all that do turn unto him, all to whom God giveth Grace to turn to him, ſhall live: But canyou tell a company of People that are yet in their ſins, that you can aſſure them, that God will give them Grace to turn unto him, that they may live. That man that could indeed aſſure all people that come to hear him, that God will certainly and infallibly give them a new Heart to turn unto him and live; this were a rare Preacher, indeed: but this no mortal man can aſſure all people of.</p>
            <p>The way that Preachers are to go, is, firſt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49367:23"/>to ſhew men, how <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, and that God is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, tho' he ſhould take vengeance upon them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. To ſhew them that there is no help and hope in their own Righteouſneſs or Strength;</hi> and to <hi>ſhew, Chriſt is an Alſufficient Saviour to all Believers; that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> And to exhort them to pray to God to give them true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to ſhew them that they have not a good thought or deſire, but what God works in them; that it is not enough for Converſion, to have Commands, Promiſes, and Threatnings ſet before them tho' God makes uſe of theſe; but to tell them as our Saviour did, <hi>that none can come to Chriſt, but thoſe whom the Father draws:</hi> None but thoſe to whom it is given of the Father; and that Sighs and good Moods, and Reſolutions in their own Strength are far ſhort of true Converſion; and that they pray and wait in the uſe of God's Ordinances, that the Lord, of the exceeding riches of his Grace, would give them a new Heart and Spirit, that they may find, that God hath put his fear in their Hearts, that thro' his Grace they may find not only ſome ſudden flaſhes, and ſudden reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to turn to God, but a penitent frame of Heart for ſin, a prizing of Chriſt, adoring of God's free Grace in him, and deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walk with God. But to entertain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Diſcourſes of By-opinions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and to talk of Univerſal Redemption is but to do people hurt inſtead of good: yea, upon preaching of Univerſal Redemption, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath ſhewn, that people generally are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49367:23"/>more Carnal and Prophane in their lives.</p>
            <p>Now to explain <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.32. <hi>I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of him that dieth:</hi> and Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael?</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is ſpoken to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not of all mankind. They were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Friend, they were under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace; what is this to all mankind? The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were aliens to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, as it is the pain and miſery of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo God hath no pleaſure in the torments of the Devils, and damned in Hell: yet it is his holy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to puniſh them there to Eternity, for the glorifying of his Juſtice.</hi> And when God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will you dye?</hi> he ſhews them that Obedience is acceptable to him, but not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he purpoſed, and intended to give all their Hearts a ſaving turn, which he could have done, if it had pleaſed him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Compare Scripture with Scripture: God ſaith, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 5.11. Neither ſhall mine Eye ſpare, neither will I have any pity, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Thus ſhall mine anger be accompliſhed, and I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them, and I will be comforted;</hi> Minuit vindicta dolorem. Iſai. 1.24. <hi>Ah, I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49367:24"/>will eaſe me of mine Adverſaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies:</hi> in the Hebrew it is, <hi>I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſelf]</hi> in ſhewing my Wrath and Juſtice upon them, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 1.25.26. but <hi>ye have ſet at nought all my Counſels, and would have none of my Reproofs, I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when you Fear cometh.</hi> All theſe texts of Scripture; thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.32.33.11. and thoſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 5.11, 13. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 1.25, 26. <hi>muſt be underſtood with great Caution and Sobriety.</hi> God doth often ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men to our ſhallow Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but <hi>we must underſtand all Scripture ſo as to know that there are no Paſſions in God's immutable Eſſence, nor any change in his Purpoſes for ever.</hi> So much in anſwer to this Author's Letter to Doctor <hi>Collings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he is up with the Doctor again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. concerning <hi>Voluntas ſigni,</hi> and <hi>Voluntas beneplaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti;</hi> but ſurely he doth not rightly engliſh <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas beneplaciti,</hi> or elſe his Printer hath not done right, for he calls it (his acceptable Will.) That which Divines mean by <hi>voluntas beneplaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, is what God himſelf hath decreed ſhall infallibly come to paſs:</hi> But as this Author ſpeaks, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Divines would be no diſtinction at all; for to be ſure, what God commands is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him: but the meaning of Divines by <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> is not what is acceptable to God from Man as his duty, but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſes to do, or ſuffers to be done for his Glory.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction of Divines being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is a great help to the underſtanding of many places of Scripture: God gives out Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49367:24"/>and Commands to men for ſeveral wiſe and holy Ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew his Lordſhip and Authority, that he hath an abſolute dominion over them, to command what he pleaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſhew what is good and acceptable to him, to ſhew what is their Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To ſhew them their inability, weakneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency; that man may ſee what cauſe he hath to be humbled, and lye low before God; for man of himſelf can do nothing of what God commandeth, from a right Principle, and to a right End, but what God pleaſes to work in us, and do for us;</hi> that is another thing, indeed as to his Elect, what he commands them as their Duty he purpoſes and promiſeth to do for them of his meer Grace and good pleaſure. <hi>Tho' man by his fall hath loſt his power to obey, yet ſurely God hath not loſt his power to command:</hi> God gives ſome Grace to obey, to others he doth not give Grace: Who ſhall diſpoſe of his Grace but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>Further to illuſtrate this diſtinction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines concerning God's Will of Precept, what he commands men to do; and his Will of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what he will certainly and infallibly do himſelf: Let it be obſerved, that God's Will, as to ſome Precepts and Commands to men do vary, and alter as it pleaſeth him. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſeveral ritual Commands about the Worſhip of God, which he required in his Worſhip under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> are altered under the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> But take God's Will for his Purpoſes and Intentions, what he will do, and he is of one mind, unchangeable from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49367:25"/>
            <p>Yea, to make this Diſtinction far more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>God doth ſometimes give out a Command to Man to do a thing, and yet may abſolutely purpoſe and intend to hinder a Man from doing of it;</hi> as in the caſe of God's Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to offer his Son <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>And he ſaid, take now thy Son, thine only Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and get thee to the Land of</hi> Moriah, <hi>and offer him there upon one of the Mountains that I will tell thee of:</hi> Abraham prepared all things to obey this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: and <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. and after he had bound his Son, ſtretched out his Hand, and took the Knife to ſlay his Son, the Lord called unto him, and ſaid, <hi>Lay not thy Hand upon thy Son, neither do thou any thing unto him:</hi> Here we ſee that God gave out a Command to do a thing which he never purpoſed and intended to be be done; yea, which he reſolved to hinder the doing of; therefore it is one thing for God to command us to do a thing, and another thing for God to purpoſe and intend this thing ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be effected: Yea, take another inſtance concerning <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 4.21. And <hi>the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>When thou goeſt to return into</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>ſee that thou do all thoſe wonders before</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>which I have put in thine Hand; but I will harden his Heart, that he ſhall not let the people go.</hi> God ſent a Command to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out of his Land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.1. but before ever <hi>Moſes</hi> came to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> with this Meſſage and Command, God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> I am ſure that the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> will not let you go, no not by a mighty hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.19. So here you ſee, that God, as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, may give out a Command to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49367:25"/>ſhew his Authority over Man, and require a thing of Man as his Duty, when he doth not intend to enable a Man to do it: Yea, when God intends to harden a Man's Heart; that is, intends to leave Man to the Corruption of his own Heart, that he ſhall never do what God commands him. If you will not adore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Majeſty and Ways of God, but compare him with Man, put Laws upon God, that he muſt do, as Man is bound to do; then, I ſay, this borders upon Blaſphemy, if it be not down-right Blaſphemy againſt the moſt high God.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>An Anſwer to this Author's Letter to Mr.</hi> H. <hi>wherein this Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to bring ſeveral places of Scripture for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT ſeems Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſent a Paper of Verſes to this Author: He anſwereth theſe Verſes by a Letter, and with this very Humble and Civil Direction <hi>[To the Nameleſs and Nonſenſical Poet]</hi> indeed I have ſeen theſe Verſes, and truly, to ſpeak my Judgment of them, tho' this Author calls them Nonſenſical, yet they were written with great Judgment [excepting the Scriptures which this Author quotes, which are excellent in themſelves, however wreſted and miſtaken by Men;] I think <hi>there is more Truth and good Senſe in thoſe Verſes, than in all this Author's Book.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49367:26"/>'Tis true, he that made thoſe Verſes did not ſhew himſelf to be a <hi>good Poet;</hi> but he ſhewed himſelf a <hi>knowing Chriſtian;</hi> and tho' I have known the Perſon many years, yet I could not have expected, that he could have framed ſo many ſolid Arguments againſt Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and if I had known before hand, that he would have written to this Author, I would have adviſed him to have written in Proſe, and not in Verſe. Good Poetry is one thing, and good Senſe is another.</p>
            <p>Theſe Verſes were againſt Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: This Author in Anſwer to this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brings ſeveral Scriptures for Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which are now to be explained.</p>
            <p>When the Papiſts bring for Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of our Saviour; <hi>This is my B dy:</hi> We deny Tranſubſtantiation, but we don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the words of our Saviour; but ſhew the meaning of the words to be otherwiſe than they underſtand them: So in dealing with this Author, we do not deny the Scripture; we hold, that Chriſt dyed <hi>for all, for every Man, for the whole World;</hi> that is, for all the Elect, for all Believers of all Nations, of all Ranks throughout the whole World; and we ſay no more is intended in any of thoſe Expreſſions, but that this Author, and thoſe that are of his Opinion, miſtake the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Before I come to explain the Scriptures this Author brings for Univerſal Redemption:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſidered. that the words <hi>[all] [every] [the World]</hi> [and the <hi>[whole World]</hi> do not always ſignify all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49367:26"/>muſt be taken in a limited, reſtrained Senſe; yea, <hi>ſometimes but for a few,</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be concluded from thoſe Expreſſions, but by conſidering the Subject matter ſpoken of, and the Circumſtances of the places of Scripture where thoſe Expreſſions are uſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for example of the word <hi>[all]</hi> it is not always meant of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, but ſometimes of but few Perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.14. <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall:</hi> whereas Men fall into ſin and miſery; yea, the greateſt part of mankind into Hell it ſelf, and the Lord doth not prevent theſe things: The meaning is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoſe that are upheld, and kept out of Sin and Miſery here, or Hell hereafter, he it is that upholds them; but this <hi>all</hi> that the Lord upholds, are indeed but a ſmall number in compariſon of thoſe that God doth not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to <hi>John, chap.</hi> 3.26. <hi>He to whom thou bareſt witneſs, behold the ſame Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth, and all Men come to him;</hi> when it was ſo few that came to Chriſt, ſo that <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>that no Man</hi> (comparatively) <hi>received his Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For that Expreſſion <hi>[every Man.]</hi> it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be taken in a limited reſtrained Senſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til</hi> John, <hi>ſince that time the Kingdom of God is preached, and every Man preſſeth into it:</hi> It was only ſome of all ſorts, and very few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe that were then living in the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal;</hi> when indeed the manifeſtation of the Spirit there ſpoken of, the extraordinary gifts of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49367:27"/>Spirit are given to few, very few; but the meaning is only, that to every one of thoſe to whom this Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given, it is, that they may profit others with it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Day of Judgment, ſaith, That <hi>then ſhall every Man have praiſe of God;</hi> which is meant only of every true Believer; for the greateſt part of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſhall not then have praiſe of God, but have the Sentence of Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſs againſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for the word <hi>[World]</hi> and <hi>[whole world]</hi> theſe Expreſſions are ſometimes taken too in a limited, reſtrained Senſe, <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>The Phariſees therefore ſaid amongſt themſelves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the World is gone after him:</hi> whereas it was but few, very few of Men then living in the World that went after Chriſt, and owned him in any Senſe, it was only of a few in that little Country of <hi>Judea</hi> that were there ſpoken of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe Days, that there went out a Decree from</hi> Caeſar Auguſtus, <hi>that all the World ſhould be taxed;</hi> it was but all the <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſome Expoſitors think; however it was but all that were ſubject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were far from being all Mankind then living in the World.</p>
            <p>I might give many more Inſtances that the word, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every Man, the World,</hi> and <hi>all the World,</hi> are taken in a limited and reſtrained Senſe ſometimes; and that nothing can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected rightly from ſuch Expreſſions, but as the Matter treated of, and the Circumſtances of the place ſhall require.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would enquire in what Senſe we are to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49367:27"/>underſtand Chriſt's dying, that we may know what we diſpute about: Let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who it was that dyed for Sinners, and this may give light into this Controverſie, tho' it was only the Humane Nature of Chriſt that dyed, or was capable of dying; yet the Perſon was God, the fellow of the Lord of Hoſts: therefore God is ſaid to purchaſe the Church with his own Blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. If Chriſt, indeed, had not been God by nature, then People might have had ſuch low, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing thoughts of his Death, as that he might dye in vain as to ſome; yea, as to all he dyed for: But we that do believe he was God-man, cannot believe but that he will infallibly ſave all that he dyed for. Indeed, if we did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and that Chriſt is the ſecond Perſon of the for ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and glorious <hi>Trinity:</hi> and that he is the Son of God by Ineffable Eternal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, very God as the Father is; and that he took upon him Human Nature, that he might ſuffer the Puniſhment of our Sins, and redeem and ſave us; we would never contend about his Death, who he dyed for; becauſe, if he had not been the Brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, he could never, by himſelf, have purged away our Sins by the Sacrifice of himſelf. It is to be feared, that ſome Arminians are Socinians too: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians, as <hi>Michael Servetus</hi> was, of whom I ſhall ſpeak afterwards, if God permit. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Arminianiſm prepares the way to Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, if God does not graciouſly ſtop Men in the way of Errour. So that this I lay down as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49367:28"/>a Baſis and Foundation for an Enquiry who Chriſt dyed for; that all would conſider the Eminency, yea, the Infiniteneſs of the Perſon that dyed for us. It was he <hi>that was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, tho' he took upon him the form of a Servant, and was found in faſhion as a Man, and was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> to redeem his Church. This was the greateſt wonder that ever was done in this World: It is the aſtoniſhment of Angels and Men to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and can any imagin, that <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, and dyed in vain for any for whoſe ſake he bare the Puniſhment of their Sins, and went through unutterable pain and ſuffering for their Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what is the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's dying for us; <hi>It is, that Chriſt dyed in our ſtead, as our Surety, and as a proper Sacrifice for our Sins.</hi> Chriſt dyed, <hi>not only for our good;</hi> as the Socinians ſpeak; <hi>but in our ſtead, as well as for our good: Our Iniquities were laid upon him,</hi> Iſai. 53.6. <hi>He bare our Sins in his own Body upon the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>He ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. for all the Sins whatſoever of them, for whom he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Who was delivered for our Offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification.</hi> Thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed, he made an abſolute, perfect ſatisfaction for all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yea, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Converting and Keeping Grace for them here, and Glory hereafter: He did not do the work of Mediator and Saviour by halves, <hi>He obtained Eternal Redemption</hi> for thoſe for whom he dyed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. he gave himſelf for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49367:28"/>thoſe for whom he dyed, to Merit and Purchaſe for them Faith, Repentance, Grace and Glory to be infallibly beſtowed upon them in the Lords appointed time and ſeaſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.13, 14. as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in a Chapter by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But as for this Author, and thoſe of his way, though they make a great noiſe about Chriſts dying for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity: Yet <hi>they do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny that Chriſt dyed for any Man or Woman in the World, in a true Scripture Senſe;</hi> that is, that Chriſt ſo dyed for any, as to make Satisfaction for all their Sins, and to purchaſe ſaving Grace here, and Glory hereafter, to be infallibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon their particular perſons; For they ſay that notwithſtanding Chriſts Death, there might not one Man or Woman in the World have been ſaved. The truth is, though ſome may mean well, and think they exalt Chriſt by the Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption: Yet they do debaſe and diſhonour Chriſt, and bring all at laſt to Mans Meriting his own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay that <hi>Arminians</hi> do Debaſe, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and Diſhonour Chriſt, and that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and for ever to be adored Redemption by him. They talk indeed of Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, but indeed <hi>it is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of that True, Perfect and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought for thoſe for whom he dyed;</hi> which ſhall infallibly bring them to Grace here, and Glory hereafter, as ſhall, God willing, be manifeſted afterwards.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay that <hi>Arminians,</hi> (whether they do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49367:29"/>really intend it or no,) bring all at laſt to Man Meriting his own Salvation. For if God the Father did no more in Electing a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Grace and Glory, and the Son of God in Redemption, and the Holy Ghoſt in infuſing a new Heart for thoſe that are Saved, than for thoſe that periſh for ever: Then thoſe that are Saved, it is by their own Merits, Worthineſs, Towardlineſs and Goodneſs above others; and ſo they are not Saved by meer Grace, not by any Special Diſcriminating Grace from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt to them; and ſo, whereas God hath ordered it ſo, that no Fleſh ſhould glory and boaſt in his preſence; Theſe lay a Foundation for pride and ſelf-conceit, and make poor proviſion for admiring free ſpecial Diſcriminating Grace here, and to Eternity in Heaven. Yea, one of the <hi>Arminians</hi> in anſwer to that queſtion, who maketh thee to differ? would not mince the matter as ſome others do: But boldly and roundly anſwered to the Apoſtles queſtion, I make my ſelf to differ.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall now cloſe with you upon the Scriptures you bring, and ſhall make it manifeſt (if the Lord put in by his Spirit to give Light) they do not hold forth that Chriſt dyed for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt you name is <hi>Hebrews</hi> 29. <hi>We ſee Jeſus made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death, Crowned with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he by the Grace of God ſhould taſt death for every Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Scripture this Author cites in the firſt place, and Mr. <hi>J. C.</hi> in his Book called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49367:29"/>redeemed, counts this Text the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of all other places for Univerſal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but indeed 'tis a notable Text againſt it, and may give us much light how to underſtand the word [all,] and [every Man] and [the World] in other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſhews what was the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Gods giving his Son to taſt Death for us, it was the grace of God; the for ever to be Adored grace of God, the exceeding Riches of his grace that ever was, or can be to thoſe perſons that God gave his Son to dye for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He expreſſeth <hi>what Chriſt ſuffered</hi> for them in purſuance of Gods eternal and infinite grace to thoſe perſons whoſe Surety and Mediator he was, and that is ſet forth by <hi>taſting of Death for them;</hi> whereby is meant, the bitter Paſſion of Chriſt, ſuffering in his Soul and Body, to bear the Curſe of the Law; the Wrath of God due to their Sins, that ſo they might not bear it themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſhews who it was that Chriſt taſted Death for, this bitter Death; in the Greek it is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which, leſt any ſhould think is meant of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, it is reſtrained by the Apoſtle himſelf; he ſhews it was only for the Elect: for it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, for whom are all things, in bringing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Sufferings:</hi> So that the Apoſtle ſhews, that the all that Chriſt taſted Death for, are all <hi>the Sons that are to be brought to Glory:</hi> all that God hath Predeſtinated to the Adoption of Children, Chriſt taſted Death for all them, and only them.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49367:30"/>
            <p>Again, he ſhews who were intended by the all that Chriſt taſted Death for, by calling him, <hi>The Captain of their Salvation;</hi> that thoſe that Chriſt, as their Captain and Leader, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conduct to Salvation, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified are all of one:</hi> The all, and every one, that Chriſt taſted Death for, is reſtrained by the Apoſtle again, to all <hi>thoſe that are, or ſhall be ſanctified by the Blood and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus</hi> their Sanctifier, and in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, For which cauſe <hi>he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren, in the midſt of the Church will I ſing Praiſe unto thee:</hi> So that the all that Chriſt taſted Death for, is all that he makes Believers, <hi>makes his Brethren, makes his Church;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold, I and the Children which God hath given me:</hi> So that thoſe that Chriſt taſted Death for, is limited to thoſe that the Father hath given him, and are the Children of God by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch as are given to Chriſt, to bring all of them, at laſt, to be actually the Children of God: So that all things conſidered, as I ſaid before, we have the Apoſtles example in enquiring into the true meaning of any Scripture that ſpeaks of Chriſt's dying for all, giving himſelf a Ranſom for all, his being a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World: to reſtrain and limit ſuch Expreſſions <hi>to the Sons that were to be brought to Glory: to thoſe that Chriſt was to make Brethren: to thoſe that are, or ſhall be ſanctified by him, to his Church; to thoſe that were given him of the Father, to be certainly and infallibly brought to Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49367:30"/>
            <p n="2">2. The next place this Author bringeth for Univerſal Redemption, is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>Who is a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> Now for the finding out the true meaning of this Scripture,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, that this Epiſtle was written to the <hi>Jews, v.</hi> 7. Brethren, <hi>I write no new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto you, but an old Commandment, which ye had from the beginning:</hi> It was the <hi>Jews</hi> that had the Commandments of God; the ſum of which old Commandments was, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and thy Neighbour, as thy ſelf,</hi> Matth. 22.37, 38, 39. As for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they had not the written Law committed to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael; <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that when the time came, that the Lord would viſit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that the Goſpel ſhould be preached unto them, it was expedient that there ſhould be ſuch Expreſſions uſed, that Chriſt was the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, not only to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to look after Chriſt, but alſo, <hi>in reſpect of the</hi> Jews, who did generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the other Nations of the World, and thought the Meſſiah was only for them; yea, for a time, the <hi>Jews</hi> that believed could hardly bear to hear of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſhews that Chriſt was not only a Propitiation for the Sins of Believers amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but for the Believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> throughout the whole World.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49367:31"/>
            <p n="3">3. The word <hi>[Propitiation]</hi> will give light into the meaning of the place, and determine the true ſenſe and meaning of it; for what is it for Chriſt to be a Propitiation for our Sins? it is to make Satisfaction and Reconciliation for our Sins; an abſolute and perfect Satisfaction for all our Sins, to the Law and Juſtice of God; and this is laid up with the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father to be certainly and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſtowed upon us in the Lord's appointed time. Thoſe that Chriſt hath died for, he hath made ſuch an abſolute and eternal Satisfaction and Reconciliation for their Sins, for all their Sins, that they ſhall certainly be Called, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Eternally Saved: So that as Divines have obſerved the true ſenſe and meaning of this place before us, is the ſame with what we have, <hi>John</hi> 11.51, 52. <hi>And this ſpake he, not of himſelf; but being High-Priest that year, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, that Jeſus ſhould die for that Nation,</hi> (that is, the Nation of the <hi>Jews) and not for that Nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, the Children of God that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad:</hi> that is, the Elect amongſt the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then he cites, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.7. <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; (I ſpeak the truth and lie not) a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity;</hi> for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, that when the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle, the Magiſtrates were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not Jews; and they were generally wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, whereupon the Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49367:31"/>through their Corruption and Weakneſs did many of them <hi>neglect to pray for them, but rather prayed againſt them:</hi> Now the Apoſtle puts them upon Prayer for theſe Magiſtrates, and ſhews them, that if God do not pleaſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, yet he can ſo over-rule them, that they may <hi>live peaceable lives,</hi> and enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of God's Worſhip in their Dominions; yea, the Apoſtle goes further, he would have them pray for the Converſion of thoſe Wicked, Perſecuting Magiſtrates, and ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 4. That <hi>God would have all Men to be ſaved, and to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> Some of all ſorts and ranks, ſome Kings and great ones, as well as mean People; and that for any thing they know, God will ſave, and bring to the knowledge of the Truth, thoſe Wicked Magiſtrates, that did then perſecute the Church; all thoſe that God will have to be ſaved, he will bring them to the knowledge of the Truth: He can eaſily do it, tho' for the preſent they be ignorant of the Truth, therefore he would have them pray, that God would convert them: and whereas ſome Profeſſors of the Goſpel then, were <hi>Jews,</hi> and were much alienated from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would take off their Prejudice from thoſe Kings, and thoſe that were in Authority, becauſe they were <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and tells them, that there is <hi>but one Mediator between God and Man, and that he gave himſelf a Ranſom for all;</hi> that is, for all the Elect, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I am a Preacher to the</hi> Gentiles; and God hath made me an Inſtrument in his Hands for the Converſion of many <hi>Gentiles;</hi> therefore why might not the Lord ſave, and bring to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49367:32"/>knowledge of the Truth, theſe Kings and great Men, as well as others, if he pleaſes: and tho' great Men have great Spirits, high, proud Spirits many times, and ſay, Who is the Lord? yet <hi>the King's Heart is in the Hand of the Lord</hi> (as well as another Man's) <hi>and he turneth it as the Rivers of Water, which way ſoever he pleaſes,</hi> Prov. 21.1. therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>I will that Men lift up holy Hands without Wrath</hi> (for theſe Kings, and thoſe that are in Authority, tho' they be wicked Perſecutors for the preſent) <hi>and without doubting of God's Power</hi> to Convert them if he pleaſes. This Paraphraſe upon the words may give light into the true meaning of the place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which may put all out of doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meaning of this place. Let it be conſidered, what it is for Chriſt to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Ranſom for Men, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Chriſt's Ranſoming Souls was not like others Ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>He gave his Life a Ranſom,</hi> Matth. 20.28. there never was ſuch a Ranſom as he gave; he that was God-man gave his Life a Ranſom <hi>for many,</hi> 'tis ſaid in that place of <hi>Matthew; for all,</hi> in this place to <hi>Timothy;</hi> both ſignify the ſame, the many that Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for, are all the Elect <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This Ranſom that Chriſt gave, was an Infinite Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, of infinite worth and value; it makes ſure and certain the diſcharge of all thoſe for whom he gave himſelf a Ranſom. When Men do well conſider of it, they will not ſo diſparage him, that was God-man, as to think that he gave himſelf a Ranſom for Men, and that yet they ſhould be Priſoners in Hell for ever. If Chriſt had only died as an Example, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49367:32"/>ſay, or for Mens good, ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it had been another caſe: but Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the room and ſtead of Men, and giving himſelf a Ranſom for them, this Ranſom will do all for them to ſecure their Salvation: And as to Faith, Repentance, and Perſeverance in Grace, they all follow upon Chriſt's giving himſelf a Ranſom; for Chriſt would not give himſelf a Ranſom at random, at uncertainties, but made ſure to purchaſe ſuch inherent Grace for all thoſe that he gave himſelf to be a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, that they ſhall be effectually converted, adore this Grace that Chriſt, God-man, ſhould give himſelf a Ranſom for them, and love him, and live to him: So that, I ſay, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, what it was for Chriſt, God-man, to give himſelf a Ranſom, is ſufficient to reſtrain, and limit the word <hi>all,</hi> to all the Elect, to all, and only them that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then this Author brings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.15. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Explanation of this Text.</p>
            <p>This Text ſpeaks only of Believers, the word <hi>all</hi> is reſtrained, and limited by the word <hi>[us,]</hi> thoſe that have believed in Chriſt, or ſhall hereafter believe in him to life everlaſting: for ſurely the love of Chriſt conſtraineth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only to love him, and to live unto him, the love of Chriſt hath no ſuch effect but upon Believers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle ſhews, that they which live
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49367:33"/>by Chriſt, they were by nature Children of Wrath, as well as others: All dead Men, as being under the Curſe of the Law, as well as others, and that Chriſt died for them, not only that they might be delivered from the Curſe of the Law, <hi>not only that they might live in that ſenſe,</hi> but that thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live from the Law, as to Condemnation, ſhould not live to themſelves, but to him that died for them, as to Sanctification alſo: That is, that Chriſt intended and purchaſed for all thoſe, for whom he died, not only that they ſhould live, as to Juſtification, but as to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sanctification too; he procured both for them, and both ſhall be infallibly beſtowed upon them; ſo that the Apoſtle's meaning is, not only that the Love of Chriſt in dying for us, is a ſtrong Argument, why they that he dyed for, ſhould live, not to themſelves, but to him: But alſo, that Chriſt both intended and purchaſed this grace to be certainly confer'd upon them, that they ſhould be ſo Sanctified, that they ſhould not live to themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them, and roſe again, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, Zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Text duely conſidered, is <hi>a not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption:</hi> For it holds forth, that all that Chriſt dyed for, he did not only intend and purchaſe that they ſhould be certainly and infallibly delivered from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but that they ſhould alſo be ſure to be Sanctified, that they might live to Chriſt in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>

            <p n="5">5. This Author mentions the words of our Saviour. <hi>John</hi> 6.51. <hi>The Bread that I will give, is my Fleſh; Which I will give for the Life of the World:</hi> For the Explanation of this Text.</p>
            <p>Conſider that our Saviour Preached but in that little Country the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and at firſt forbad his Diſciples to go and Preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom our Saviour ſpake theſe words, had a ſtrong conceit (as was hinted before) that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was for that Nation only: Therefore now the time drew near, that many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be Converted; our Saviour tells them, that he will give his Life for the World, not only for thoſe which the Father had given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but amongſt the other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World: Amongſt whom many now were to be Converted, <hi>for this was a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that Chriſt was to be Preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and be believed on in the World,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. for though there were many Propheſies of the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet they were little underſtood, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith that this was a <hi>Myſtery which in other Ages was not made known to the Sons of Men,</hi> (that is, not clearly made known) <hi>that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhould be Fellow-Heirs of the ſame Body, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel:</hi> And this is the reaſon why Chriſt ſaid that he gave his Life for the World, not that he gave his Life for all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, but for all that the Father had given him amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The next place this Author brings, is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>for therefore we both labour and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49367:34"/>reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe:</hi> For Explanation of this place of Scripture, the Apoſtles went through great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and dangers in preaching the Goſpel, yet they went on in their work, truſting in the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, who is the <hi>preſerver of Men,</hi> that is, the meaning of the Saviour of all Men. In this Text God doth afford wonderful outward preſervation to all Men in their callings, when he pleaſes; but he is the Saviour and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Believers eſpecially, who are expoſed to more outward dangers from Enemies, than other Men are, and eſpecially Miniſters, they are in danger of Death often, yet God preſerves them from many and unknown dangers, until they have done their work, and ſerved their Generations according to the will of God. Therefore the Apoſtle and others of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would truſt in the living God, they would leave all to Gods Providence, would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of any amazement, but go on in the way of their Duty; this is the meaning of the words, the Apoſtle is not here ſpeaking of Chriſt as Mediator, and of Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation by him, but of the Providence of God, as the Preſerver of Men, of which Men in general have Experience, but Faithful Miniſters, and other Believers, eſpecially ſo far as God ſees fit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then this Author quotes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 3, 4. <hi>This is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have opened theſe words before, when I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49367:34"/>diſcuſſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. but to ſay a little more. The meaning of theſe words is, that God will have ſome of all Nations, ſome of all ranks, Princes as well as Subjects: Yea, though thoſe Princes and Magiſtrates be wicked Perſecutors, yet they may be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth: Therefore the Apoſtle would not have the profeſſors of the Goſpel exaſperated againſt them, as they are apt to be; but ſaith, it is good and acceptable in the ſight of God to pray for them, if perhaps God will give them Repentance, to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth, and they have Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray; becauſe God will glorifie his free grace in Chriſt, in Converting and ſaving ſome of all Nations, and of all Ranks, and ſome that for a time make havock of the Church. If Men will not be content with this expoſition of the words, that by [all] is not meant all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, but only ſome of all ſorts; It may be, that they think that all <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhall be ſaved, though they don't think fit to ſay ſo openly: For when it is ſaid, God would have all Men to be ſaved, to underſtand it of all individuals in the World, they muſt either ſay that God cannot do what he will, which is Blaſphemy, or elſe they muſt hold that all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity ſhall be ſaved, and indeed, Univerſal Redemption hath a tendency to that Opinion; but Men dare not ſay ſo, whatſoever they think, becauſe ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Texts of Scripture are againſt it: But if God would have all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth, who could let it, for he doth whatſoever he pleaſes;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49367:35"/>his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The next place is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome Men count ſlackneſs; but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould Periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the underſtanding of this Text, let is be conſidered what is meant by that expreſſion, <hi>the Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe.</hi> By the promiſe is meant Chriſt's promiſe to come the ſecond time without Sin to Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. laſt. Our Saviour at his firſt coming, had the Sins of his People to ſatisfie for, and he hath done that work, he hath offered one Sacrifice for Sin for ever; but he is to come the Second time without Sin to Salvation, without any Sin of his People to make atonement for, but then he ſhall come in all his glory: And when Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall appear with him in glory. But it might be ſaid, why is he ſo long before he comes, ſeeing that he hath promiſed to come the Second time? The Apoſtle anſwereth, that the Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe of coming, but there is a ſet appointed time for it; and there are yet of the Elect to be Converted, <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Lord is long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us ward; by the [us] is meant the Elect amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> not willing that any, that is, that any one of the Elect ſhould Periſh, but that [all] ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, all the Elect. So that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words is, that though the World be ſo full of Sin, yet Chriſt doth not come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49367:35"/>to execute Judgment, until all the Elect are brought to Repentance, and then he will come in all his glory, all the Elect muſt be born, and born again before Chriſt comes to Judgment: He is not willing that any one of them ſhould Periſh, but that all of them ſhould come to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Then we are to conſider, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.29, 30, 31. <hi>Foraſmuch then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the God-head is like unto gold, or Silver, or Stone graven by Art, and Mans Device; and the times of this ignorance God win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at, but now commandeth all Men every where to Repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day, in the which, he will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open this place a little, <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to the Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> who were greatly addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idolatry: He ſhews them what a groſs conceit it was, and indeed contrary to the light of Nature, to think that the Godhead is like unto Gold, or Silver or Stone graven with Art and Mans Device: Yet he ſhews them that God had given up the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to this groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23. and <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. God had ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways, and here <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>the times of this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, God winked at;</hi> which muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if God had not puniſhed them here, and in Hell, for their Idolatry and other Sins: But the meaning is, that God let them alone to walk in their Blindneſs and Ignorance. Gods Election then ran chiefly, and almoſt wholly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49367:36"/>amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but [now] that Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction runneth among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Now the time is come to viſit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to take out of them a People for his Name, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men every where, in all Nations where we his Miniſters come, to repent of their Idolatries, and other Sins in a more eſpecial manner, than ever he did before, that Men turn from Idols to ſerve the living God; and this is a notable ſtartling Argument to move them to Repent, and turn to God: For there is a Terrible Day of Judgment to come, when God will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man [Chriſt,] whom he hath ordained to be Judge of the quick and the dead.</p>
            <p>What is this to Chriſts dying for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity but againſt it? For we ſee there how God ſuffered the Nations to walk in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous courſes, and did not ſend any to Preach the way of Salvation to them: And whereas [now] God commanded Men to Repent by the Preaching of the Apoſtles; this was to bring in the Elect among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and obſerve, that as to the Elect, the Lord doth not only command them to Repent, by the Preaching of his Miniſters, but gives them Repentance it ſelf by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The next place is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>As by the Offence of one Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all Men unto juſtification of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the underſtanding of this Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond Man the Lord from Heaven were both
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49367:36"/>publick perſons. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the room of his Seed: The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the room of his Seed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that the Apoſtles ſcope in this Text and Context, is not at all to compare the two <hi>Adams</hi> as to the number of their Seed, as if Chriſts Seed were equal in number with the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> Seed; but the Apoſtles intent is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to compare the Power and Influence of the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, to bring Condemnation upon all his Seed, with the power, Efficacy and Vertue, of the Second <hi>Adams</hi> Righteouſneſs, to bring the juſtification of Life: And to that end, the Apoſtle ſhews that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by one ſin, by one offence, brought his Seed into a State of Condemnation: And the Second <hi>Adam</hi> by his Active and Paſſive Obedience, did take away for his Seed, not only the Sin that came upon them by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>their many Offences</hi> committed in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>v.</hi> 16. So that, let it be well obſerved, the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that <hi>as Death and ondemnation came inevitably upon all the firſt</hi> Adams <hi>Poſterity by his fall, ſo ſhall the free gift of Righteouſneſs come infallibly upon all in whoſe room and ſtoad Chriſt dyed, as their ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>their Surety and Mediator.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adams [all,]</hi> was all Mankind, the ſecond <hi>Adams [all]</hi> was all the Elect, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly, ſhall both Juſtification and Sanctification come upon all Chriſts Seed, whoſe publick perſon he was, all for whom he obeyed the Law, and bare the Curſe of it. So that tho' every ordinary reader may not be able to take up the right ſenſe of this place, the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49367:37"/>Apoſtles ſcope is, that as Death came in by one publick perſon, ſo Life and Salvation came in by another publick perſon: And that the Lord Jeſus will infallibly juſtifie, and ſave his [all] for whom he undertook, and dyed as their Head Repreſentative, ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Mediator. This Text and Context right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, throws down the conceit of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption to the ground.</p>
            <p n="11">11. then the Author puts two Scriptures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but nothing to the purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> And John 5.29. <hi>They that have done good unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt Text. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> The Apoſtle there is ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and though all ſhall be raiſed up at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt, yet in this 22 <hi>v.</hi> and the next, <hi>the Apoſtle is ſpeaking only of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Bodies of the Saints:</hi> He firſt ſhews how Man came to be liable to natural Death, and ſaith, <hi>in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye;</hi> by his ſin and fall, Man came to be liable to natural Death, as it was penal indeed, not only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but ſpiritual, and liableneſs to Eternal Death came upon us by <hi>Adam.</hi> But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here is ſpeaking only of Natural Death; well, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> But ſaith he in the next Verſe, <hi>every one in his own order, Chriſt the firſt Fruits,</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they that are Chriſts at his Coming.</hi> Chriſt the Head of the Church; He was the firſt that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49367:37"/>roſe from the dead by his own power, as he was God, and he was the chief, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon that ever was, or ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Dead; and then he ſaith, that they that are Chriſts, they ſhall be <hi>raiſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as Chriſt the Head, is raiſed from the Dead: So they that are Chriſts, all that are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Myſtical Body, they ſhall be raiſed at his ſecond coming: And the other Text <hi>John</hi> 5.29. ſhews, that as Believers ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, that they may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not only in their Souls, but in their Bodies too: So the wicked they ſhall be raiſed too at the day of Judgment, that in their Bodies as well as in their Souls, they may be puniſhed for ever. I wonder that this Author ſhould ſo much as name theſe two Texts for Univerſal Redemption.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The next place is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily ſhall bring in Damnable Hereſies, even deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift Deſtruction.</hi> As to this place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tis very conſiderable, what is ſaid by the Learned Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> for the underſtanding of theſe words, that is, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] here uſed, is not wont to be applyed to the Son; but appropriated to the Father, and that [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is conſtantly given to the Son, the Lord Chriſt: And ſo he Explains it by <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Is not he thy Father, that has bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee?</hi> So that the words may be underſtood of God as Creator, and common Benefactor that had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49367:38"/>bought them by outward and common Mercies, as he is ſaid to ahve bought <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take notice, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which we tranſlate bought, doth often ſignify Freeing, making Free; ſo that theſe falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might be ſaid, by the power of common En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, to be made free from many groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and groſs Sins for a time; and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were entangled in vile Doctrines and Practices, and returned with the Dog to the Vomit: This Expoſition will ſtand very well.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if their being bought, ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of their being bought by Chriſt, then the meaning is only this, That <hi>theſe Apoſtates once thought, that Chriſt had bought them, as well as others, and the Brethren in the Judgment of Charity thought them to be ſuch too, as Chriſt had redeemed:</hi> But if Chriſt had indeed bought them by the ineſtimable and infinite price of his Blood, who is God as well as Man; he would either have kept them out of thoſe vile Hereſies and Practices they fell into, or would, after their fall, have renewed them again to Repentance; for Chriſt, God-man, is able to get and keep what he hath bought with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, and will certainly and infallibly do it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Then for <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scope of the Apoſtle in that place, is to ſhew the different degrees of Light and Knowledge the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, and that they ſhould be judged accordingly. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had only the dim light of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49367:38"/>Nature, which yet did reveal <hi>ſome things</hi> unto them, as that there was a God, that Parents were to be honoured, and that they ought to be kind and juſt one to another, and the like: But the <hi>Jews</hi> had the written Law, which declared more of the Will of God to them: Now the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>v.</hi> 12. That <hi>as many as have ſinned without Law,</hi> that is, that never had the written Law, <hi>they ſhall periſh without Law;</hi> that is, they ſhall not be judged and condemned for breaking the written Law that was given by God to <hi>Moſes;</hi> but they ſhall be judged and condemned for ſinning againſt the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But whereas it might be objected, How could they be guilty of Sin, who never had the Written Law? the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which have not the</hi> (Written) <hi>Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law: Theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves:</hi> that is, in ſome <hi>few things</hi> they have the Light of Nature to be a Law, and Light to them: This the Apoſtle ſets forth yet further, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>which ſhews the work of the Law written in their Hearts;</hi> that is, that tho' they had not <hi>that Supernatural</hi> Writing of God's Law promiſed to the Elect, in the Covenant of Grace, yet they have a Natural Writing of the Law in their Hearts, in ſome few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (as was ſaid before) and the Apoſtle gives this Demonſtration of it, that theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> have ſome knowledge of Good and Evil; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Conſciences ſometimes <hi>accuſe</hi> them, and bear witneſs againſt them; and ſometimes their Conſciences <hi>excuſe them as to ſome Acts;</hi> but the Apoſtle ſhews, that their Conſciences
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49367:39"/>will more fully accuſe them in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that they ſhall have nothing to ſay, why they ſhould not have the Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation paſs againſt them: Then the Apoſtle ſhews, that God will judge the World by Jeſus Chriſt at the laſt Day, <hi>according to my Goſpel;</hi> that is, according to the Doctrine that I Preach: This Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> preached upon all occaſions, that God would judge the World by that Man [Chriſt] whom he had ordained: This ſhort Paraphraſe may give light into this Context; I wonder that any ſhould bring this place for U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Redemption.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Another place he brings, <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 1.23. <hi>If ye continue in the Faith, grounded and ſettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every Creature which is under Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Chriſt had commanded, the Apoſtles had preached the Goſpel all over, to every Man and Woman to whom God gave them Opportunity, but the Goſpel had not been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally preached before to all Nations; nor hath it been ſo generally preached ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time: But in oppoſition to <hi>Judea,</hi> the Goſpel was preached all over, it was not confined to <hi>Judea:</hi> Not that the Apoſtles, or any other, did at that extraordinary time preach the Goſpel to every individual perſon then in the World, but to a <hi>great number</hi> then in all Nations then known: Surely there were not then Preachers enough to go to every Town; but the time being come to call the Elect amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Lord ordered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49367:39"/>ſo much Preaching every where, as ſhould be ſufficient to bring thoſe to believe who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained unto Life. Chriſt being preached to a Nation, or a Town, is no proof that Chriſt died for all that Nation or Town, but when the Lord orders by his Providence, that the Preaching of the Goſpel is ſent to a place, it is a ſign that there are <hi>ſome Elect, and ranſomed People</hi> there, whom the Lord will call out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light.</p>
            <p n="15">15. I ſhould have named one Text before, that this Author ſets down, and that is, <hi>John</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World, to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved: He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God:</hi> For the underſtanding of this Scripture, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that our Saviour ſpeaks theſe words to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they had an Opinion, that the Meſſiah was to come only for them: They looked for the Meſſiah to come as ſome great Monarch to tread down all the other Nations of the World, and to ſet up the <hi>Jews</hi> in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eſtate, as to outward Dominion. The generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo blinded, that they did not look for the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as a Spiritual Saviour, but as one that ſhould deſtroy the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World by outward force: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour tells them, that he was not ſent now, <hi>at his firſt coming, to deſtroy, judge, and condemn any;</hi> but he was ſent to ſave the Elect, not only amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> throughout the whole World, and that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49367:40"/>whoſoever believeth on him, whether he be a <hi>Jew</hi> by nature, or a ſinner of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not condemned, but he that believeth not for the preſent, nor hereafter, is condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>viz. by the Sentence of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. under which Sentence of Condemnation he muſt abide, becauſe he hath not believed on the Son of God, which is the only way and means to deliver any from the Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which the Law hath paſſed upon them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>God ſheweth to all Men, by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſomething of what is Morally good, ſomething of what God, as Creator, requireth of them; and to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom thoſe words are ſpoken, as is plain to be ſeen in that Chapter, God did ſhew to them more of his Mind and Will, what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and required of them; what is this for Chriſt's dying for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity?</p>
            <p n="17">17. Then he quotes <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.8. <hi>The Lord is Gracious and full of Compaſſion, and of great Mercy:</hi> 'Tis certain, that the Lord is Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and full of Compaſſion, and of great Mercy: But <hi>he hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. The Grace and Mercy of God is to be adored for ever, that he <hi>ſaves any</hi> that have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Sinning againſt the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is ſo hemous, that God's Grace and Mercy is unconceivable in ſaving any, tho' it had been much fewer perſons than he doth ſave; and his <hi>holy Juſtice</hi> is to be adored for ever in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49367:40"/>ſo many with Eternal Damnation for Sin: There is ſuch infinite Mercy in God, that he could have pardoned all the Angels that ſinned; and could have ſaved all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity <hi>if he had pleaſed;</hi> there might have been no Hell, no place of Torment for Devils or Men, if he had pleaſed, there might have been no place but Heaven for all the Angels, and all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men to ſing Halelujahs to Eternity; but we muſt not order what God ſhall do, how he ſhall exert and put forth his Attribute of Mercy: O that there were more Reverence of the Divine Majeſty, more holy trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, more wondring that he ſhould ſhew Mercy to any, and eſpecially to our ſelves! for he hath his Glory not only in them that are ſaved, but in them that periſh: In them that are ſaved he hath the Glory of his Grace, and in them that periſh, he hath the Glory of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Pſalm 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is good to all, as a Creator, during the Day of his Patience and Long-ſuffering; and what Mercies he affords may be called Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies, conſidering our Vileneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, who deſerve every moment to be caſt into Hell. We are to adore the common Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God to all, in his Patience and Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for a time in this World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This place of Scripture may be applied to the Saints only; for it follows, <hi>All thy Works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee: They ſhall ſpeak of the Glory of thy Kingdom,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49367:41"/>and talk of thy Power,</hi> v. 10, 11. So I ſay the words may be underſtood, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is ſpeaking of Gods being good, in an eſpecial manner, to all thoſe whom he makes his People, and that his tender Mercies are over them; over all the Saints, who are the Works of his Hands, in an eſpecial manner, that are made new Creatures by him, his new Creation in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take <hi>[all]</hi> for all Mankind, 'tis certain that the Lord is not pleaſed to ſhew them ſuch Goodneſs and tender Mercy, as to give them a new Heart, ſo as to take away the Heart of Stone, and to give them a Heart of Fleſh, and ſave them for ever; which he could eaſily have done, if he had pleaſed; and the more are they beholden to his, for ever to be adored, Grace, to whom he is ſo good towards, whom he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch tender Mercy, as to take away, and remove all Mountains of Guilt and Rebellion that ſtand in the way to hinder their Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thus I have explained thoſe Scriptures this Author brings for Univerſal Redemption, which, indeed, <hi>intend no ſuch thing:</hi> If the Lord be not pleaſed to give us light into the meaning of Scripture, we ſhall father our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Miſtakes upon the word of God; we muſt compare Scripture with Scripture; we muſt bring a humble Mind to the ſtudy of the Scriptures: We muſt pray continually to the Father of Lights, and of Spirits, that he would lead us into all Truth: We muſt not interpret any Scripture, ſo as to derogate from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Attributes; we muſt not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49367:41"/>interpret any Scripture, ſo as to derogate from the Infinite and Eternal Vertue and Merit of our Saviour's Death; 'tis always new, and of Infinite Efficacy, for all he died for, to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</p>
            <p>Then it follows in this Author, <hi>By theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities I teach, that Chriſt died for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that ſo do others that you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they teach that Chriſt died for all, that is, all the Elect, all that the Father hath given him, all that believe and truſt in him; but if you teach that Chriſt died for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, <hi>you teach you know not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray conſider, that when our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour died as a Surety and Mediator, it was near four thouſand years from the Creation, and there were multitudes then in the Priſon of Hell, from whence there is no Redemption; and do you think that Chriſt, God-man, died upon the Croſs, and bare ſuch unutterable Dolour for them, to redeem them that were then in Hell?</p>
            <p>There was reaſon, indeed, that Chriſt ſhould die for thoſe Saints that were <hi>in Heaven</hi> before he died, becauſe they were pardoned and ſaved, upon the account of his having undertaken, as Surety for them, to make ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for their Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. And <hi>for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by means of death, for the Redemption of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they which were called might receive the Promiſe of the Eternal Inheritance.</hi> The Father truſted Chriſt, (as we may expreſs it) upon his Covenant, and undertaking, as Surety, to make ſatisfaction to Juſtice; and ſo he pardoned and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49367:42"/>ſaved the Saints of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt actually died for them: And as for the Elect that were then living, and were to live afterwards in their Generations, Chriſt truſted the Father with the Payment and Satisfaction he made for them by his Death, that they ſhould have the benefit of his Death in due time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them: It ſounds well enough in the Ears of Chriſtians, that Chriſt was but once to offer himſelf a Sacrifice, and that therefore when he died, he bore the Sins of the Saints in Heaven, becauſe they came there upon the account of his Covenant and Undertaking with the Father, that he would, in the fulneſs of time, take upon him Humane Nature, and would, as their Surety, make Satisfaction for their Sins: But ſurely it will ſound very harſhly in the Ears of all Chriſtians, that Chriſt, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhould ſweat drops of Blood, and die, bearing the Curſe of the Law for them, who were then in Hell when he died; except Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians think that the damned in Hell ſhall be ſaved at laſt. Indeed, ſome paſſages of thoſe of that Judgment, have a tendency to ſuch an Opinion; but ſuch Doctrine is contrary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. and the laſt Verſe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>Then this Author goes on, <hi>Sir, ſhew me, if you can, where the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt, died but for ſome only, not for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, this is but ſtrife of words; Chriſt did not die only for ſome of the Elect, but for all the Elect, but he died not for all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Poſterity, as hath been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49367:42"/>
            <p>He goes on, and ſaith to this perſon, <hi>Seeing you think that Chriſt died but for ſome, ſhew me ſufficient teſtimony from the Scripture, that he died for your ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray, what Call hath this Author to put this Perſon upon declaring to him ſufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that Chriſt died for him? and what is this to the purpoſe, if this perſon had not yet attained what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> But I hope this Perſon hath a comfortable aſſurance, that Chriſt died for him: Chriſt died for all Believers; and if he finds upon Self-examination, that he is in the Faith, and Chriſt lives in him; he may conclude, that Chriſt died for him: But why he ſhould give this Author ſufficient Teſtimony of his Faith I know not: It may be, ſome will ſay, this is but a hectoring, boyſterous way of dealing.</p>
            <p>The Author concludes his Letter, ſaying to this Perſon <hi>[Name one in this great City for whom Chriſt died not:]</hi> What is this to the purpoſe, to prove Univerſal Redemption? Tho' Chriſt did not die for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity; and tho' there be in this City, many ignorant and prophane People; yet it would be preſumption to ſay of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular perſon in this City, yea, in the whole World, that Chriſt did not die for that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; except one knew that the Perſon had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is a ſin which few are guilty of; and for ſuch <hi>we are not to pray for them,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. but for any other particular perſon, tho' for the preſent he be never ſo ignorant of God, and abound in Tranſgreſſions, who can ſay, but that this perſon may be one of thoſe that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49367:43"/>to Eternal Life, and that Chriſt hath died for? and therefore we are to exhort them to Repentance, and pray for them, and if it be ſo, that they be ſuch as God hath choſen to Salvation, and that Chriſt hath dyed for them, the Lord will at one time or other before they dye, turn them from Darkneſs unto Light: Deliver them from the Power of Darkneſs, and Tranſlate them into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</p>

            <p>I have ſaid enough already, I hope, to clear thoſe Scriptures that this Author brings for Univerſal Redemption. Now through the Lords Aſſiſtance, I ſhall ſhew, that though <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> make ſuch a poor, low, common thing of the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, who was God, as well as Man; That they ſay, that Men may be Damn'd in Hell for ever, notwithſtanding Chriſt dyed for them; I ſhall prove the contrary by many Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>John</hi> 10.15, 16. <hi>I lay down my Life for the Sheep, and other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: Them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice; and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:49367:43"/>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, that <hi>there are ſome that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſts Sheep, before their Converſion,</hi> given to Chriſt, that he ſhould be the Shepherd and Biſhop of their Souls, in the appointed time, to bring them to Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Sheep are the Elect,</hi> both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſome are of the Fold of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome of the Fold of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Chriſt laid down his Life for theſe Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>Chriſt hath undertaken to bring in and Convert thoſe Sheep that he laid down his Life for,</hi> that not one of them be miſſing and Periſh: Therefore Chriſt puts [a <hi>must</hi>] upon it. I <hi>muſt bring,</hi> as if he had ſaid, becauſe of my engaging to the Father in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to bring them to Grace and Glory; as alſo becauſe of my own free and everlaſting love to them, I <hi>muſt</hi> bring them home.</p>
            <p>Ay, but ſome might ſay, True, Chriſt may uſe ſome means outward and inward, to bring in theſe Sheep that he dyed for, but peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they will ſtop the Ear, and their wills be rebellious: Ay, but ſaith Chriſt, they <hi>[ſhall] hear my Voice,</hi> that is, they ſhall certainly and infallibly be Converted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve that thoſe that Chriſt dyed for, <hi>he Reconciled them to God,</hi> made Satisfaction and Reconciliation for all their Sins. Chriſt dying, was no ſmall matter; It was not a thing of ſmall Power and Vertue; it was not to make
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49367:44"/>God meerly Reconcileable; but it was a perfect and eternal Reconciliation: Though the benefit of his Reconciliation is given out in a certain order, and manifeſted by degrees, as ſeemed good to the Counſel of Gods Will, yet Chriſt did all by way of Merit and ſatisfaction for ſin, when he dyed upon the Croſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that ſuch a Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by the Death of Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>how much more ſhall we be ſaved by his Life?</hi> That is, by his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion for them for whom he dyed. Thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed, for them he roſe again. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and laſt v. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> Chriſt as the Head and Surety for thoſe for whom he dyed, was diſcharged of the debt of their ſins by his Reſurrection: So that, as he dyeth no more, death hath no more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him: So all that he dyed and roſe again for, ſhall be brought into ſuch a ſtate by Vertue of his Death and Reſurrection, that death ſhall not have Dominion over them. Chriſt alſo aſcended into Heaven as a publick perſon, and Repreſentative of thoſe for whom he dyed. For all them whoſe high prieſt he was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus made a high Prieſt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec, for them <hi>he ever liveth to make Interceſſion,</hi> until they be all brought to Glory, he preſents his Merits, his Blood, his Satisfaction in the Holy of Holies for them. So, that unleſs Men will ſay that Chriſt did not riſe again and aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and doth not ever live to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49367:44"/>it muſt needs be, that all that he dyed for, ſhall be eternally ſaved: For ſaith the Apoſtle, if we were Reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, how much more being Reconciled ſhall we be ſaved by his Life? If there were ſuch Merit in his Death as to Reconcile us to God: Then Chriſt riſing again, aſcending into Heaven, and ever living to make Interceſſion for thoſe for whom he dyed, they ſhall all be certainly and infallibly brought to Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall be not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve the <hi>[all]</hi> here is not all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, but all that God hath an Eternal purpoſe of Grace to, which are in due time called according to his purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elect <hi>v.</hi> 33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? Thoſe whom he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, v. 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle makes this to be a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, that God ſhould not ſpare his Son, but deliver him up to Death as Mediator, and Surety for us: <hi>In this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. God manifeſts his love in giving other things, but in this, the love of God was moſt of all manifeſted, that God ſent his Son to dye for us, that he ſpared not his Son, but delivered him up to bear the Curſe of the Law in our ſtead. <hi>Thanks be to God for his unſpeakable gift,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. Conſider the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49367:45"/>perſon that he delivered up to dye for us, he was his own Son, his proper natural Son, and tis ſaid, he ſpared him not, he ſpared him not from nor in dying, but made him to bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable grief in Soul and Body, as Surety and Mediator for thoſe for whom he dyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle doth poſitively conclude, that all thoſe that God hath ſuch love to, as not to ſpare his own Son, but to deliver him up to Death for them, that God would certainly and infallibly, and freely give them all things, that is, <hi>all things neceſſary to their Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> Thoſe for whom God would give his Son, to them he will freely give Faith, Grace and Glory: The new Heart is the gift of God, and a great gift, but nothing to Gods not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own Son, but giving him to dye for us. Gods giving his Son to dye for any perſon, was the higheſt expreſſion of his love to that perſon, that ever was, or ever could be: If God had ſuch a love to give his Son to dye for a Man, he will ſtick at nothing to bring about the Eternal Happineſs of that perſon. He ſpared not his Son, that he might ſpare that perſon: He puniſhed his Innocent Son, as Surety, that he might not puniſh that perſon for his Sins: He was at coſt indeed to Redeem a perſon by the price of the Blood of his own Son: But as to giving that perſon a new Heart, <hi>He can more eaſily do it, than we can ſpeak a word;</hi> There is ſuch ſtrength in the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, as carries all before it, throws down all Cavils and Objections whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may draw another Invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who ſhall Condemn?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49367:45"/>Chriſt hath dyed, yea, rather is riſen again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle here ſhews, that thoſe that Chriſt dyed for, he roſe again for them, he ſits at Gods Right Hand for them, he makes Interceſſion for them, that they may infallibly obtain all that he Merited and Purchaſed for them, by his Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle in the Name of all that Chriſt dyed for, <hi>makes a challenge; Who ſaith, he ſhall Condemn? Chriſt hath dyed:</hi> Ay, but the Law and Juſtice may Condemn; no Chriſt hath dyed: Chriſt hath delivered them, for whom he dyed from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. he hath made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for their Sins, by his Death. But thoſe that hold univerſal Redemption, may ſay, O <hi>Paul,</hi> why do you Argue thus, that if Chriſt dyed for us, we cannot be Condemned to Hell? Ay, but <hi>Paul</hi> knew what he ſaid, he knew how to argue from Chriſt dying for us, that we ſhall never be Condemned to Hell. Thoſe that hold that Chriſt dyed for all <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, of which the greateſt number are, or ſhall be Condemned to Hell for ever, make nothing, or next unto nothing, of Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a perſon: But <hi>Paul</hi> makes it ſuch a great thing for Chriſt to dye for us, that he is bold to ſay, who ſhall Condemn? Chriſt hath dyed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. John 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all Fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal Life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour often ſpeaks of them that were<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49367:46"/>
               <hi>given him of the Father,</hi> that is, the Elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there was a Covenant of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Chriſt, wherein he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to bring them to Glory, and that he might not fail of ſaving every one of them; Chriſt as the Mediator, had power given over all Fleſh: Yea, over all Devils too, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould hinder, but that he ſhould infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly give Eternal Life to as many as the Father had given him to Redeem and Save. Chriſt as God had all power of himſelf: Chriſt as Mediator, had power given him over all perſons, and things in ſuch <hi>a perfect manner,</hi> that nothing ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Salvation of thoſe that were given him. Chriſt as Mediator hath abſolute power over the <hi>Hearts and Wills of Men,</hi> to alter, change and frame the Wills of all that the Father hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, to bring every thought into Obedience to him, that all the Elect ſhall be <hi>a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the day of his power,</hi> he puts forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>irreſiſtibly, ſo far as infallibly to Convert them,</hi> and puts forth his power after their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>irreſiſtibly, ſo far as to preſerve them to the Heavenly Kingdom.</hi> Chriſt is mighty as God, and mighty as Mediator; Hath abſolute power over all Fleſh, over their very Hearts and Wills, to open their Hearts to receive him, to work their Wills to embrace him whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleaſes; and will certainly do it for thoſe that the Father hath given him to Redeem and Save.</p>
            <p n="6">6. John 17.19. <hi>And for their ſakes, I ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie my ſelf, that they may be Sanctified through the truth:</hi> Our Saviour being now near his Death, he declares who he was to dye for, not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49367:46"/>for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity; but for thoſe whom the <hi>Father had given him</hi> to be the Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof he is the Head, and declares, v. 9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the World, but for them whom thou haſt given me, for they are thine:</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, I am ſo far from dying for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, that I will not ſo much as pray as Mediator, for any but thoſe whom thou haſt given me. I dye to bring the many Elect Sons to Glory, and for their ſakes, ſanctifie I my ſelf, that is, I Conſecrate and Dedicate my ſelf as their High-Prieſt, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf a Sacrifice for them, that they may be ſanctified through the Truth, that is, that they may be juſtified and ſanctified through him, that they might not any one of them miſs of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Gal. 2.20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is here ſetting forth the Love of Chriſt to him, and as an Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Demonſtration and proof of the for ever to be adored love of Chriſt to him, he ſaith that Chriſt gave himſelf for me, that amongſt thoſe that Chriſt had ſuch great and ſpecial love's to, as to dye for them: He was one, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me. <hi>Paul</hi> thought that Chriſt dying for him, was the greateſt Love that Chriſt could ſhew to him: But now thoſe that hold that Chriſt dyed for all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, might ſay, O <hi>Paul,</hi> do you make ſuch a great buſineſs of Chriſts giving himſelf for you, and that this ſhall ſecure your Salvation. We hold he dyed for Multitudes that are, and ſhall be in Hell for ever: Ay, but <hi>Paul</hi> knew better than <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49367:47"/>do, both what unſpeakable love it was for Chriſt to die for a perſon, and he knew the certainty of the Eternal Salvation of all thoſe for whom Chriſt died, he rejoices, and triumphs in this, that he knew he was one of thoſe whom Chriſt loved, and gave himſelf for.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Epheſ. 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt alſo loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of Water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be Holy, and without blemiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle exhorts Husbands to love their Wives, and with a great and ſpecial Love, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it Now, if Chriſt had loved all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſo, as to give himſelf for them; this had been no Argument for Husbands to love their Wives with a great and ſpecial Love: but rather an allowance to Husbands to love other Women with as great and ſpecial Love as their Wives: But the Apoſtle ſhews it was a great and ſpecial Love that Chriſt had to his Church, ſuch a Love as he gave himſelf for it.</p>
            <p>By the Church, here, is meant, all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; all that by the Decree of God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were to be the Lord's, the Lamb's Spouſe; for this Church only that Chriſt as Mediator was to be Head and Husband of, did Chriſt give himſelf. This Church he was to Sanctifie, this Church he was to waſh from their Sins in his own Blood; and whatſoever they were in themſelves, polluted, defiled with Sin, yet he undertook both to Juſtifie them, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49367:47"/>them, who alſo will infallibly do it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ninth Argument to prove, that all that Chriſt died for, ſhall certainly be ſaved, ſhall be taken from <hi>thoſe Scriptures that make it manifeſt that thoſe that Chriſt died for, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Faith and Sanctification for them, as well as Reconciliation for their Sins,</hi> Gal. 1.4. <hi>Who gave himſelf for our Sins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World, according to the Will of God, and our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, that thoſe that Chriſt died for, <hi>the Heart of the Father</hi> was in this thing, it was from the <hi>Will,</hi> the great Love and good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Father, that he ſhould give himſelf for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt did give himſelf for their Sins,</hi> that is, to take away their Sins, <hi>and that he might deliver them from this preſent evil World,</hi> that is, not only from the Guilt and Puniſhment due to them for their Sins, <hi>that ſo they might not be condemned with the World;</hi> but that he might deliver them from the <hi>evil Manners of the World, from the wickedneſs of this preſent evil World,</hi> and to make them new Creatures, he purchaſed Sanctification for them, to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly beſtowed upon them, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See in the Verſe before, who it was that gave himſelf for us; the Apoſtle calls him, <hi>the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ay, this puts infinite value into his dying for us, that he is God as well as Man, and ſo cannot be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Ends, which he had in his Death:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49367:48"/>and the Apoſtle here ſhews, that his End was to purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works: He intended for all for whom he died, not only to redeem them from the guilt of all their Sins, but purchaſed Sanctifying Grace for them, whereby they might be made a peculiar People, zealous of good Works, which according to his mighty Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf, <hi>he will certainly do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Pet. 1.18, 19. <hi>For as much as ye know, that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold from your vain Converſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition from your Fathers; but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, ſhed his precious Blood, not only to take away the guilt of Sin, but to Sanctifie them; to deliver them for whom he died, from <hi>the Vanity of their Minds, and from their Vain Converſation,</hi> that ſo they may be brought to walk with God here, and come to Heaven hereafter; and all that do partake of Mortification of Sin, and Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Grace; it is by Vertue from the Death of Chriſt: he hath given Sin a mortal wound by his Death, he hath nailed it to his Croſs, that at laſt, all that he died for ſhall be wholly freed from it for ever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>The laſt Argument that all thoſe that Chriſt died for, ſhall certainly be ſaved, is taken from ſeveral paſſages in the</hi> 53th <hi>Chap. of</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>where we have ſuch an illuſtrious Propheſie of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There the Prophet ſpeaks of the great Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt the Mediator, <hi>He was wounded
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49367:48"/>for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> v. 4. <hi>and the Iniquities of all the</hi> Iſrael <hi>after the Spirit;</hi> that is, all the Elect of God were laid upon him, to bear the Puniſhment due to their Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Prophet ſhews the effects of Chriſt's Death,</hi> what benefit comes to them for who he died, he ſaith, <hi>by his Stripes they are healed, v.</hi> 5. He ſhews what Grief and Sufferings he went through to make Satisfaction for Sin, and compares our Saviour in his Death to <hi>a Woman in Travail:</hi> Ay, Chriſt had a hard Travail, and ſore Pains in Soul and Body to expiate Sin; but he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> v. 10. <hi>he ſhall ſee of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of his Soul and be ſatisfied;</hi> he ſhall not bring forth Wind, ſuch a windy, empty, poor Redemption as <hi>Arminians</hi> talk of, who ſay, that notwithſtanding any thing that Chriſt did in the Work of Redemption, there might not one Man or Woman in the World have been ſaved; but he brought forth <hi>a Perfect, Glorious, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption,</hi> ſo that all the Children of his Croſs, all that he had that hard travail for upon the Croſs, ſhall be eternally ſaved; and ſo as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>For the Joy that was ſet before him he endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame:</hi> The Joy that was ſet before Chriſt, as Mediator, when he endured the Croſs, when he died upon the Croſs, was not only the Glory that ſhould follow to his Humane Nature, but the Glory that the manifold Wiſdom, infinite Grace, and the holy Juſtice of God ſhould have to Eternity, by ſaving the Elect in ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful way by his Croſs; and likewiſe this was part of the Joy ſet before Chriſt, when he died
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49367:49"/>upon the Croſs, that all that he died for ſhould be eternally ſaved, and ſtand before the Throne as his Redeemed People.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured, <hi>for the Honour of our Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thoſe that believe on him, to maintain, that he hath not failed in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but for all that he undertook to die, as their Surety and Mediator, he will bring them to Eternal Bleſſedneſs. <hi>Now to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſent him, to the Son that was willing to take our poor Humane Nature upon him, and die for our Sins; and to the Holy Ghoſt that doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and infallibly apply this glorious Redemption that Chriſt hath wrought to all, for whom he died, be Glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen. And for thoſe that catch at a few Words and Phraſes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make this Redemption by the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to be inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to any for whom he died; I bow my Knees, and pray to God for them, that he may pleaſe to give them Light and Underſtanding, that they may be taken off from their erroneous Conceits concerning our Saviour, and the for ever to be adored Redemption by him which ſtandeth ſure for ever.</p>
            <p>But to remove what Doubts and Temptation may ariſe in the thoughts of ſome upon two places of Scripture: It is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. But <hi>if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not charitably, deſtroy not him with thy Meat, for whom Chriſt died; and through thy Knowledge ſhall thy weak Brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.11. from theſe two places ſome maintain, that thoſe that Chriſt died for may be damned in Hell.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49367:49"/>
            <p>Now for the underſtanding of theſe two Texts, obſerve, that ſome walked very uncharitably towards thoſe that were fellow Members with them; they pretended more Light, and that they ſaw their Liberty further than thoſe which they counted <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> did <hi>about eating of ſome Meats which others ſcrupled:</hi> Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, to thoſe that accounted themſelves ſtrong: Deſtroy not him with thy Meat for whom Chriſt died: Thoſe that are fellow Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Church, you ought to judge of them <hi>with a Judgment of Charity,</hi> that they are the Elect of God, and ſuch as Chriſt died for; therefore don't do that which tends to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying and ruin; and thro' thy Knowledge, thy pretence of having more Knowledge, and to have a greater Latitude, ſhall thy weak Brother periſh for whom Chriſt died; if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Light and Satisfaction in his own Conſcience, he ſhould be emboldened to do thoſe things, by your Example you draw him to ſin, <hi>which deſerves Damnation;</hi> but that <hi>eventually,</hi> any ſhall periſh for whom Chriſt really died, cannot be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe Scriptures, or any others; thoſe that we in Charity think are ſuch as Chriſt died for, may periſh, we ought to think in Charity, that all that are Members with us in the Church, are partakers of the Heavenly Calling, and ſuch as Chriſt died for, tho' <hi>in foro dei,</hi> in the ſight of God, who knoweth infallibly who are his, they are ſuch as Chriſt never died for: our Judgment of Men that Chriſt died for them, is but <hi>a Judgment of Charity,</hi> not <hi>a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Infallibility:</hi> But can any one think, that if Chriſt, God-man, did really die for a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49367:50"/>Perſon, had ſuch inconceiveable Love to him, and had endured ſo much for his Salvation in his Agony in the Garden, and upon the, Croſs that he would not take ſuch care, that this poor Soul ſhould not eternally periſh, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the uncharitable carriage of ſome proud, giddy Profeſſor: yea, if Chriſt really died for any Perſon, all the Wiles and Devices, and fiery Darts of all the Devils in Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to deſtroy and ruin ſuch an one, tho' other Profeſſors be uncharitable and hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to give offence to the weak, and ſhake them, and endanger them; yet Chriſt the Meek, the Pitiful and Merciful, and Almighty High-Prieſt, will not ſuffer a bruiſed Reed to be broken, nor ſmoking Flax to be quenched: but tho they may fall, yet ſhall they riſe again; Chriſt ſaith to the Sheep, that he laid down his Life for, that <hi>they ſhall never periſh;</hi> and that none, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men or Devils, ſhall pluck them out of his Hand, <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28.</p>

            <p>THis Author in his Dialogue with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. doth cite a paſſage in the Confeſſion of the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the Decree of God for the manifeſtation of his Glory, ſome Men and Angels are Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto everlaſting life, and others fore-ordain'd to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49367:50"/>everlaſting deſtruction: and thoſe Angels thus Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated and fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably deſigned, and their number ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be either encreaſed or diminiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis either for want of acquaintance with Books, or want of Ingenuity, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor falls upon the Presbyterians, <hi>as if they only were of this Opinion.</hi> The Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> publiſhed their Confeſſion of Faith but about 46 years ago.</p>
            <p>But firſt I ſhall ſhew that the Epiſcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, long before them, printed and publiſhed the ſame Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider of the Doctrine it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas this Author would ſuggeſt, as if the Presbyterians only held this Doctrine, and ſo caſt an odium upon them, <hi>I ſhall ſhew, that the Epiſcopal Divines did publiſh the ſame Doctrine long before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1552 ſay, <hi>Predeſtination to Life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby (before the Foundation of the World was laid) he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly decreed by his Counſel ſecret to us, to deliver from Curſe and Damnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen out of Mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt to everlaſting Salvation, as Veſſels made to Honour. Wherefore they which be endued with ſo excellent a benefit of God, be called according to God's purpoſe, by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, they through Grace be juſtified freely, they be made the Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like to the Image of his only begotten Son, Jeſus Chriſt: they walk reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly in good Works, and at length, by God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49367:51"/>they attain to everlaſting Felicity,</hi> Article 17. Here is plainly aſſerted, that there is an Eternal Election of certain Perſons, that they ſhall be certainly and infallibly called to Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And as for the 31th Article which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mentioneth, tho' he did not think fit to meddle with the 17th. <hi>Chriſt is a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Propitiation, and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, both Original and Actual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They having before aſſerted the Doctrine of God's Eternal Election of ſome, this Article may fairly be interpreted, that Chriſt is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redemption, Propitiation, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all the Sins of the whole World, of the Elect, or of all the Elect in all Ages, and of all Nations throughout the whole World, and for them only: and their words being well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will conſtrain ſuch an Interpretation: To be ſure they did not hold, that all Mankind ſhould be ſaved; and therefore ſaying that Chriſt is a perfect Redemption, Propitiation, and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, they cannot be underſtood to mean any more than this, that there is no other name under Heaven, by which Men can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus Chriſt; there is not Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any other. It is he alone that is a Perfect Redemption, Propitiation, and Satisfaction for Sin; ſo that whoever are ſaved in any Age or Place throughout the whole World, are ſaved by him only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The firſt Articles of the Church of</hi> England, being not ſo explicit and plain about Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> being broached, there was

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Deus ab aeterno praedeſtinavit quoſdam ad vitam; quoſdam reprobavit ad mortem.</p>

            <p>Article 11. <hi>God from all Eternity did by his unchangeable Counſel, ordain whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſs, yet, ſo as no Violence is offered to the Wills of the Reaſonable Creatures, and neither the Liberty, nor the Contingency of ſecond cauſes is taken away, but rather Eſtabliſhed.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Article 13. <hi>Predeſtination unto Life, is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the World were laid, he hath conſtantly Decreed in his Secret Counſel, to deliver from Curſe and Condemnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of Mankind, and to bring them by Christ, unto everlaſting Salvation, as Veſſels made to Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Article 14. <hi>The cauſe moving God to Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto Life, is not the foreſeeing of Faith, or Perſeverance, or of good works, or of any thing which is in the perſon Predeſtinated, but only the

            </p>
            <p>Article 32. <hi>None can come to Chriſt, unleſs it be given to him, and unleſs the Father draw him, and all Men are not ſo drawn by the Father, that they may come unto the Son, neither is there ſuch a ſufficient meaſure of Grace vouchſafed unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, whereby he is enabled to come unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi>

            <p>I have cited theſe Articles to ſhew this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and others of his mind, that there is no cauſe for any to fly out againſt the Aſſembly of Divines, or any Presbyterians, for what they hold about Election and Reprobation, and ſuch points, as if it had been ſome new Doctrine that they had broached, but every one may now ſee, that next to the Scriptures, they learnt this Doctrine of the Epiſcopal Divines that were before them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us conſider the Doctrine it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the Doctrine of Election, let us ſee what this Author ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 27.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God did <hi>chooſe in Chriſt unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all that part of the fallen race of Mankind, that dye in their Innocency, or accept of his Mercy and Grace, according to the means he gives them, and this Decree proceeds from his own goodneſs, and is not built upon any goodneſs in the Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>that God did chooſe in Chriſt to Salvation, all that part of the fallen Race of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>that dye in their Innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I Anſwer 1. This Author quotes not one Scripture for this <hi>ſtrange Aſſertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I wonder who they are of the fallen Race of Mankind, that can dye in their Innocency?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49367:54"/>I ſuppoſe he means young Infants, thoſe that dye in their Infancy. But though thoſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Innocent comparatively, yet beſides the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, which is upon every one of his Poſterity by Nature, <hi>as a conſequent of it,</hi> all have loſt the Image of God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; and have contracted by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſuch an Univerſal Depravedneſs, that they have the Root, the Spawn and Seed of all Sin in them, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> This Corruption of Nature, is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in every one that comes by <hi>Adam,</hi> in a way of ordinary Generation: So that not one is born without it. It comes by propagation from <hi>Adam,</hi> and if <hi>a Child dye the firſt day it is born into the World, it doth not dye in Innocency;</hi> but if it be ſaved, it is waſhed, and made white in the Blood of the Lamb, and hath the habit, and principle of Grace infuſed into it, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out outward means: God that formeth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Rational Soul that the Infant hath, <hi>can form Grace in the Soul of the Child, as he pleaſes,</hi> can Sanctifie it in the Womb, or as ſoon as it is born, if he be graciouſly pleaſed ſo to do. But how doth the Infant dye in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency? Alas, there is an Univerſal depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Soul of an Infant, which if it live to be capable to expreſs it, will diſcover it ſelf: A young Cub of a Fox or Wolf, doth not preſently diſcover its ravenous Nature, but it is inherent in it, bred with it, and Men kill thoſe young Cubs, though they never yet did any miſchief; becauſe it is their Nature to be Ravenous and Miſchievous; An Infant hath the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49367:54"/>ſame reaſonable Soul, that it hath, if it live to be a Man, though it doth not expreſs it ſelf, as it doth when it lives to Age. So an Infant hath the Seed of all Sin, a corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it doth not Act, as it doth when Age comes on; and I ſay, that God may for the Guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, and becauſe there is ſuch Enmity, Rebellion and Wickedneſs in Mans Nature againſt him, he may if he pleaſe, glorifie his Juſtice upon them; though they dye in their Infancy, they are far from dying in Innocency.</p>
            <p>I do not think God would have deſtroyed the old World, and called them <hi>the World of the Ungodly,</hi> amongſt whom, no doubt there were many Infants, and deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and made them ſuffer <hi>the Vengeance of Eternal Fire,</hi> amongſt whom, no doubt there were many Infants, if every Infant were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. I will not meddle to determine the Eternal Eſtate of thoſe that dye in Infancy, to be ſure, you go too far to aſſert what you do, you are not the Soveraign Lord, and Judge of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You ſay that God did chooſe thoſe that accept of his Grace and Mercy, according to the means he gives them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I hope you mean his Grace and Mercy <hi>in Chriſt, that they know him, and believe in him,</hi> for elſe there is no Salvation: If the Goſpel be hid, if Chriſt as Mediator, be not ſome ways made known to Men, they are loſt for ever. 2 Cor. 4.3. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath Life, and he that believeth not on the Son, hath not Life.</hi> But you ſeem to hold, that 'tis not of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49367:55"/>neceſſity to Salvation to know Chriſt, and him Crucified as Mediator, but to have ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions of Univerſal Grace and Mercy in the Divine Eſſence, which Men do own and accept of, and truly <hi>you ſay, that few knew the Mediator by the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, till he was born of the Virgin,</hi> page 21. That is nothing to the purpoſe, all that were ſaved, knew the Mediator <hi>as the Seed of the Woman that was to break the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>As he that was to offer himſelf a Sacrifice for</hi> Sin, and therefore God taught them to offer Sacrifices preſently after the fall, by which they looked to Chriſt that was to come: <hi>Jacob</hi> called him <hi>Shiloah,</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Peace-maker</hi> that was to come, <hi>Job</hi> called him <hi>his Redeemer.</hi> All that ever were ſaved before Chriſt came, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not by meer believing that God was Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and Gracious; But that he would ſend his Son to dye, to be a Sacrifice for Sin: And they embraced the promiſe of Chriſt, the only Mediator and Sacrifice for Sin that was to come: And all that are ſaved, ſince our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours coming, do in ſome meaſure know and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, that dyed without the Gate of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> You will leave us a ſtrange <hi>Creed,</hi> if you leave out the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that it is not neceſſary to believe in him to everlaſting Liſe?</p>
            <p>Ay, but <hi>you ſay, the Turks themſelves begin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Chapter in their Alcoran, with theſe words, In the Name of God, Gracious and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> page 21.</p>
            <p>And what then, <hi>are the Turks in a State of Salvation,</hi> who deny the Trinity, deny Chriſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49367:55"/>to be God, deny Chriſt to have dyed, but one in his Room; and put up <hi>Mahomet</hi> an Impoſtor as the great Prophet? Indeed <hi>your Friend</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus, <hi>Converſed much with the Turks, and would have had a Reconciliation of the Turkiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be, this Author doth not underſtand the danger of <hi>theſe Opinions, but they tend to the Subverting of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> What if the <hi>Turks</hi> have a Notion that God is Merciful and Gracious: They, and all others will, find that except they come to God by Chriſt the Mediator, the Sacrifice for Sin, they will find God to be a conſuming fire to them.</p>
            <p>This Authors mentioning of the <hi>Turks,</hi> puts me in mind of a Diſcourſe I once had with a <hi>Quaker,</hi> one of the moſt knowing Men that ever I knew of that way, and he ſaid, the <hi>Turks</hi> were as good Saints, as any were in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Indeed, the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> they run all upon this, that there is a ſufficient light, that God gives to all Mankind, that if they do but heed that Light, it will bring them to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Ay, and ſo our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Knowledge of him, and Faith in him, muſt be but an indifferent thing, and not abſolutely neceſſary, that they may maintain their Opinion of Univerſal Grace. What dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is coming upon this Land, that the blind, lead the blind after this manner?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Well, then ſet that queſtion aſide for the preſent, what that Mercy and Goodneſs of God is, that if Men accept God from the beginning, choſe them to Salvation in Chriſt: What, is this the Election, the Scripture ſpeaks of?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49367:56"/>
               <hi>Here is not a Syllable of Gods purpoſing of his meer Grace infallibly to give them a new Heart, to give them Faith and Repentance;</hi> and ſo they muſt thank themſelves if they be ſaved: The <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> will allow God only to decree, that all ſhall be ſaved that are ſo wiſe and careful as to believe in Chriſt, by improving that common and univerſal Grace that is afforded to them that are damned, as well as thoſe that are ſaved: They will not allow that God hath elected any Perſons from Eternity, ſo as that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly call them, and that they ſhall obey that Calling; that thoſe Perſons from God's ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Grace, ſhall be infallibly ſaved, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If there were no other Election but this, there might not one Man or Woman in the World have been ſaved, but bleſſed be the Name of God for ever: God hath from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity choſen particular perſons to Salvation: choſen them ſo as to give Chriſt for them, and certainly and infallibly to give Chriſt with all his Benefits to them.</p>
            <p>Acts 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life believed:</hi> they were not ordained to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, becauſe they believed, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved becauſe they were ordained to Eternal Life: there were ſome of the Hearers that God had from Eternity ordained to Eternal Life, that were now to be ſavingly called, and to them God gave a new Heart, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when others contradicted and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</p>
            <p>Epheſ. 1.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49367:56"/>with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be Holy, and without blame before him in Love, having predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, to the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Here we ſee, that thoſe that God bleſſeth with Spiritual Bleſſings, Juſtification, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, Grace and Glory, it is <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt, all is communicated through him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that God doth <hi>in time</hi> Juſtifie and Sanctifie, <hi>he purpoſeth to do it for thoſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before all Time,</hi> even from Eternity; 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had choſen them before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World was laid. God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity choſe Chriſt to be their Mediator and Head, and choſe them to be the Members of his Myſtical Body: He did not chooſe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any foreſight of Holineſs in them; but choſe them <hi>to make them Holy, and without Blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If any ask the Queſtion, <hi>Why God choſe thoſe individual perſons,</hi> and not others, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhews, that it was <hi>the good pleaſure of his Will,</hi> v. 5. <hi>to the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace,</hi> v. 6. to the praiſe of the Glory of his Diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating, Diſtinguiſhing Grace, <hi>who will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to whom he will be gracious, and will have compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Men and Devils ſay againſt it.</p>
            <p>Revel. 13.8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall worſhip him</hi> (that is, the Beaſt) <hi>whoſe names
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49367:57"/>are not written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> As Chriſt, the Mediator, was fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World, to be Mediator, and was ſlain in the Decree and Purpoſe of God from Eternity: ſo there were the Names of thoſe he ſhould be ſlain for in time, written in the Book of Life; not that God uſes Books and Writing, as Men do, but the Perſons of thoſe that were Elected from Eternity, were as certain, ſo many, and no more, as if they had been written in a Book: And becauſe they were thus Elected, God will not ſuffer them to be finally deceived to worſhip the Beaſt, 1 <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Knowing Brethren, beloved, your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God, for our Goſpel came not to you in Word only, but in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far as we can know that the Goſpel comes with Saving Power upon the Hearts of any; ſo far we know their Election before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World: Men are not elected when, or becauſe the Goſpel comes with ſaving Power upon their Hearts; but becauſe God had elected them to Life from Eternity, therefore he ſets home the Goſpel in due ſeaſon with Saving Power upon their Hearts.</p>
            <p>2 Theſſ. 2.13. <hi>But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, Brethren, that God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation through Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. God's chooſing from the beginning unto Salvation, is meant, of his chooſing them from Eternity, to the End, <hi>viz.</hi> to Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49367:57"/>
            <p n="2">2. Through Sanctification and belief of the Truth, ſhews the way by which God eternally intended to bring them to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle ſhews, that God did in his eternal chooſing of them, freely purpoſe to bring them into this Grace wherein they ſtood; that is, he decreed to give them that Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth, which he had now actually beſtowed upon them: Thoſe whom God hath choſen to the End, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; them he hath choſen to the Means, to make them partakers of ſpecial Grace to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly beſtowed upon them.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8.29, 30. <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brethren: Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome that God did in an eſpecial manner foreknow: God did from Eternity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know all Perſons and Things: Ay, but God is ſaid to foreknow ſome in an eſpecial manner [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] ſignifies a foreknowing with Love, and Favour, and ſpecial Regard: He alſo did Predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, to make them Holy like Chriſt in their meaſure; he ſhews, that that Fore-knowledge, that Free-love, was the cauſe of predeſtinating them to Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make it plainer, he ſaith that whom he hath predeſtinated, them he hath alſo called; thoſe whom God did Predeſtinate to Life, from Eternity, them he calls in time: They

            <p>Obſerve, God did not predeſtinate Species, or Kinds, or Qualities, but Perſons: not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate Men that he foreſaw would believe in Chriſt; but he predeſtinated them to be ſavingly, certainly, and effectually called: and this God effects in all that he hath predeſtinated to Life. There is not one whom the Lord hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to Life, from Eternity, but he calls him effectually in his own time.</p>
            <p>Rom. 11.5, 6, 7. <hi>Even ſo at this preſent time alſo, there is an Election of Grace; and if by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace, but if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Work. What then?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the Election hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi>

            <p>The Body of the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> they were caſt of, they were left to their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and blindneſs of Heart: Now leſt any ſhould wonder at this, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath not caſt off his people whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,</hi> that is, whom he had Elected unto Life: God never fails of Converting and Saving them; and ſhews, that as in the great defection in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> God had a Remnant, a few that did cleave unto him; even ſo now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time alſo, there is <hi>a Remnant according to the Election of Grace;</hi> tho' the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> do not believe in Chriſt, yet there are ſome do believe, the Elect do. He lets them know, that there is <hi>an Election, and that of Grace,</hi> of meer Grace; and that tho' others do not believe in Chriſt, yet the Remnant, the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49367:58"/>few that God of his Grace had Elected they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and were ſaved.</p>
            <p>And <hi>v.</hi> 6. he ſhews, that both Election, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Juſtification are <hi>of meer Grace</hi> in Chriſt, and not of Works and Worthineſs in the Creature at all, that thoſe that are elected, and do believe in Chriſt, when others are not elected, and ſo never have it given them to come to Chriſt, it was purely from the free Grace of God to them; and ſo concludes: <hi>The Election,</hi> that is, thoſe who are elected to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they obtain Grace and Glory, and the reſt of Men and Women then, and ſo likewiſe in all Ages they are blinded, they are left to themſelves, and to their Sins.</p>
            <p>I might mention many other Scriptures but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Ay, but ſaith this Author in that 27th page, <hi>No Man that is an unregenerate Sinner is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected, till he turns from Sin, and accepts God's Mercy by Faith,</hi> Revel. 17.14. <hi>Theſe ſhall make War with the Lamb. and the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and they that are with him are Called, and Choſen, and Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay that no Man is actually elected till he turns from his Sin, and accepts of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by Faith, is to confound the immanent Acts of God with his tranſient Acts. Election is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Act of God 'tis the Purpoſe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Perſons from Eternity. Converſion is a tranſient Act of God in time, wherein he puts forth his Power, and Converts according to his Eternal Purpoſe and Grace; and for that only Text this Author brings, it ſeems plainly to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49367:59"/>be meant, of thoſe that ſhall deſtroy the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who may be ſaid to be called and choſen, and faithful in that Work, tho' they were never called to be Saints; never elected to Salvation, never truly faithful: As <hi>Cyrus</hi> of old was called God's Anointed, and his Servant, in being an Inſtrument of God's taking Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, tho' he was a Heathen, Carnal-man: But take it for Effectual Calling, being choſen to Salvation, and faithful in Chriſt, it ſignifieth nothing at all to your purpoſe. I hope that they that are choſen from Eternity, may be ſaid to be choſen to all Eternity: Once choſen of God and ever choſen: It may be ſaid here in this Life, and a thouſand of Years hence, and to all Eternity, that they are the choſen of God, for he abides by his choice for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then you ſay, that none are actually Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till they depart from God, or reject his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodneſs, which he graciouſly holds forth to them,</hi> Rom. 1.28. <hi>And even as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, God gave them over to a Reprobate Mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that he ſpeaks of, had <hi>ſo much knowledge of God, as to leave them without excuſe,</hi> v. 20. <hi>ſo have all that periſh:</hi> But thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, had not ſo much as ſufficient <hi>outward means</hi> to bring them to know God in Chriſt; but they ſo groſly prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Light of Nature, to change <hi>the Glory of the Incorruptible-God, into an Image of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible-Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping things:</hi> that God in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49367:59"/>Righteous Judgment gave them up to vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge; that is, they did not walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Knowledge of God they had by the Light of Nature, (for knowledg of God in Chriſt, which alone can bring Men to Eternal Life, they had none) therefore <hi>God gave them over to a Reprobate Mind:</hi> They had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Mind by Nature, and ſo have all Men; that is, a Mind void of Judgment and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, till God takes it away. God's Decree to deny his Grace to Perſons from Eternity, is one thing, and a Reprobate Mind, a Mind void of Underſtanding, is another thing; and is more or leſs, as God gives up Men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and this, ſaith he, is ſo clear, that thoſe who are our Adverſaries are forced to allow it; for thus they ſpeak, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. of their Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>God did from all Eternity decree to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Elect, notwithſtanding they are not juſtified till the Holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Chriſt to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that when the Aſſembly of Divines ſay, that God did from all Eternity Decree to juſtifie the Elect, yet they are not juſtified till the Holy Spirit doth actually apply Chriſt: You ſeem to have quite forgotten what you were treating of, and ſo inſtead of caſting a ſlur up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aſſembly of Divines, you caſt a great ſlur upon your ſelf, as if you did not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what you write of: for obſerve, you are writing of Election, and you bring a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Aſſembly about Juſtification; you would prove, if you could, that none are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Elected until they believe; and ſay, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49367:60"/>the Aſſembly are forced to allow, that none are actually juſtified till they do believe. Surely that grave Aſſembly of Divines was never ſo abuſed as by you: they knew well enough what they ſaid: I would you had the thouſandth part of the Knowledge they had: <hi>The Aſſembly ſay well, that God decreed to juſtifie the Elect from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo he decreed to Sanctifie them from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but they are neither actually Juſtified nor Sanctified, until the Holy Spirit do call them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is one thing, Juſtification is another:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is an Immanent Act of God, and from Eternity: Juſtification is a tranſient Act of God towards the Elect in time. Ay, but this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will make this matter evident to every conſiderate Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> that none are actually Elected until they be Converted.</p>
            <p>Saith he, <hi>All that are actually elected have an Inheritance in the Kingdom of God, and none can lay any thing to their charge,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 4. Rom. 8.33. <hi>But no unbelieving Drunkard, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Eph. 5.5. <hi>And theſe Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be laid to their charge; therefore no unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Drunkard, Whoremonger, or Idolater is actually Elected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To explain this, 1. There is an Eternal Predeſtinating ſome Perſons to the Heavenly Inheritance, by the meer good pleaſure of God's Will, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Counſel of his own Will.</hi> Here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhews, that whether they be <hi>Jews,</hi> who <hi>firſt truſted</hi> in Chriſt, or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49367:60"/>brought to truſt in Chriſt after the <hi>Jews, v.</hi> 12, 13. yet whatſoever they are, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that truly truſt in Chriſt, they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a right to the Heavenly Inheritance: Then he ſhews, how they come to be partakers of this Grace, to have Chriſt given for them, and given to them; and this he ſhews in theſe words, <hi>Being predeſtinated according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of him, who worketh all things according to the Counſel of his own Will:</hi> He would have them know, that all that God doth for them in time, is, becauſe he had predeſtinated them, and choſen them from Eternity to Grace and Glory. So let that be well obſerved, that all that God hath predeſtinated to Life, have the Heavenly Inheritance allotted and appointed to them, it is theirs by Predeſtination, by Election.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Title to the Heavenly Inheritance by the purchaſe of Chriſt the Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is an actual right to the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance by Regeneration and Adoption.</hi> Theſe three things conſidered, the Anſwer to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is, That all that are ſaved, had a Title to the Heavenly Inheritance <hi>from Eternity by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> by the Gracious Decree of God, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was prepared for them to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World:</hi> As if our Saviour had ſaid, You that are ſaved, look to the <hi>firſt cauſe of it,</hi> you were Bleſſed of my Father, he elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from Eternity, he gave me to die for you, he called you in due ſeaſon, and made you a peculiar People, zealous of good Works; and thus you come to inherit the Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49367:61"/>
            <p>Again, <hi>The Elect, before Converſion, have Right, in Chriſt their Head, to the heavenly Inheritance, before they be called,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath <hi>purchaſed</hi> it for them. Yea, Eternal Life was promiſed to Chriſt for them, as their Head in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, before the World began, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12. But when the Apoſtle ſaith, that no wicked Man hath any Inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. the meaning is only, that though God may have purpoſed in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Counſel to give the Heavenly Inheritance to a Man that for the preſent is ungodly, and Chriſt the Mediator may have purchaſed the Heavenly Inheritance, yet this is a ſecret thing known only to God himſelf: But for what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears yet to the unregenerate Man himſelf, or to others, he hath no Part nor Lot in that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, <hi>Ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> The Apoſtle ſeems in this place to anſwer to two Objections that ſome might make.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is long before ſome that are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, are called; and if they be not called, they cannot be juſtified; and ſo if they ſhould die before they are called, What will become of them? The Apoſtle ſhews, that though God hath not yet called them, he will call them; and though there might be a Charge of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sins againſt an elect Perſon, before he be converted, yet, Who ſhall lay them to the Charge of God's Elect, to damn them in Hell?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49367:61"/>They are Elect, and God's Election ſtops any Arreſt of an Elect Perſon, ſo as that he cannot be thrown into Hell. The Elect have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, in order to their Pardon in God's Time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It might be objected, That whereas the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>Ver.</hi> 30. Whom he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, them he alſo juſtified: Have not the Elect, after they are called, if they live any long time after their Converſion, committed many Sins that might be laid to their Charge? They did not ſin only before they were called, but ſin much after they are called: How then are they juſtified? The Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect,</hi> with effect, ſo as to bring them to Damnation in Hell? Though every Sin they commit doth deſerve E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation, yet 'tis God with whom they have to do; and ſeeing he will not take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but glorifie his Free Grace in Chriſt to them, who hath to do with it? God that may do it, he juſtifies them.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Apoſtle goes on, and ſhews, <hi>v.</hi> 34. that the Elect are ſecured from Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Hell, not only by Election, but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: That though they have deſerved it as well as others, yet, ſaith the Apoſtle, who ſhall condemn (that is, the Elect) eventually and eternally? Indeed, they are condemned by the Law, till they be in Chriſt: But who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, ſo as to get Execution againſt them in Hell, ſeeing they are God's Elect, and Chriſt hath died for them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men know not what they do, when they ſet their Wits on work to deny that God hath ſet his free and unchangeable Love upon ſome from Eternity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49367:62"/>he will certainly and infallibly bring them to Grace here, and Eternal Glory hereafter, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For obſerve, <hi>Take away Election, and you take away Redemption;</hi> for Redemption is grounded upon Election, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me:</hi> Thine they were by Election, and therefore thou gaveſt them me to redeem, and bring to Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take away God's Eternal Election</hi> of a certain number of Perſons to Grace and Glory, and <hi>you take away Effectual Calling,</hi> and Converſion. For if God, of his mere Grace and good Pleaſure, had not ſo elected them, there had never been any Perſon effectually called. 'Tis God alone that doth inwardly and effectually call any, ſo as that they are ſavingly converted; and if he had not freely predeſtinated and elected them, he had never called and converted them: <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them he hath alſo called,</hi> Rom. 8.30.</p>
            <p>Take away God's Eternal, Special and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Love to a certain Number, that he will ſet them before his Face for ever; and if we were <hi>in Heaven,</hi> we could not be ſure to continue there. What a Multitude of Angels ſinned and were thruſt down to Hell? It was Election that ſetled the Angels that ſee God's Face for ever. The Angels that ſtand are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Elect Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. God decreed from Eternity to determine and fix their Wills unto himſelf for ever. It is from this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Unchangeable Love of God in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the Angels and Saints in Heaven are upheld in Love and Praiſe unto God for ever.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49367:62"/>
            <p>It hath been an old Objection of Arminians, and revived by this Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. <hi>That many have deſpaired of Mercy, and have laid violent hands upon themſelves; and many,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>in this City:</hi> He mentions it, that they fall into this Deſpair becauſe they are told Chriſt died but for a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, This Objection uſeth to be brought too againſt Election. For my part, I do not remember that ever I knew any in my whole Life, that laid violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves becauſe they heard that Chriſt did not die for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, or that they were not elected. The truth is, thoſe that make away themſelves may ſometimes get ſuch things into their Thoughts, as that they have committed <hi>the Sin against the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that they are not elected, and Chriſt did not die for them: But <hi>the true cauſe</hi> of their laying violent hands upon themſelves is <hi>ſome extraordinary worldly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> which worketh Death, (in that ſenſe,) or <hi>Exceſs of Melancholy, whereby they are ſo diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are not themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to Deſpair of Mercy; If God give up a Man to Satan, and his own Heart, how eaſily may any Man fall into it, though he hold Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption, and deny Election? For our Saviour ſaith plainly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Few</hi> there be that find the ſtrait Gate, and narrow Way. Yea, I will maintain, that the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Redemption, and of Chriſt's dying only for the Elect, and that the Elect whom Chriſt died for ſhall certainly and infallibly be ſaved, is <hi>an Antidote</hi> againſt Deſpair, if the Lord pleaſe to put in with it: And that the denying of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and holding Univerſal Redemption, is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49367:63"/>the way to bring thoſe that have a deep Senſe of their own Sinfulneſs and Unworthineſs, is the way to bring ſuch to utter Deſpair of Mercy.</p>
            <p>I make it out thus: Take a Perſon that is throughly convinced of Sin, that ſees, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he hath a <hi>Depth of Sin in his Nature,</hi> that ſees himſelf <hi>vile and abominable,</hi> by reaſon of the univerſal Corruption of his Nature, as well as actual Sins, more than the Hairs of his Head, which cannot be numbred: You come to this humbled, convinced Perſon, with your Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Doctrine, and tell him that God did not decree any Perſon to Salvation from Eternity, of mere Grace to give them infallibly both Grace and Glory, but that Chriſt died for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity. Saith the convinced, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sinner, Shall all be infallibly ſaved that Chriſt died for? You muſt tell him, according to the tenour of your Doctrine, No, there were many of them in Hell when he died, and never ſhall be ſet at liberty from their Everlaſting Chains of Darkneſs. Yea, you can tell them, according to your Doctrine, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's Death, there might not one Man or Woman in the World have been ſaved. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this Doctrine is enough to drive Men into Deſpair. Ay, but you can tell them, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth, ſhall be ſaved: Ay, and ſo can others tell them, as well as you, though they hold Election, and that Chriſt died only for the Elect: For if God gives Faith, that is a certain ſign of Election, and that Chriſt died for that Perſon.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49367:63"/>
            <p>Well, Now let us ſee what thoſe that hold Election, and that Chriſt died only for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, can ſay, in a <hi>Miniſterial and Doctrinal Way,</hi> to keep a convinced, humbled Sinner from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Mercy; I ſay, in a Miniſterial, Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Way; for it is <hi>God alone that can do it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and effectually.</hi> Now therefore our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can ſay to ſuch a convinced, humbled Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is ready to deſpair; God hath from Eternity decreed, of his mere Grace in Chriſt, to give Grace and Glory to certain Perſons; and ſome of theſe Perſons that God intended to make everlaſting Monuments of his Free Grace, are not only by Nature Children of Wrath, as well as others, but in time are Monſters in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Actual Sin; as <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the Thief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and <hi>Paul,</hi> for perſecuting the Church of God; but being elected to Life, and Chriſt dying for them, they are converted and ſaved: And who knows but that you are of that number? There is a <hi>May be,</hi> that you are an Object of this Special Grace; and 'tis certain, if that you, being convinced of Sin, do venture and truſt in God's free Mercy in Chriſt, you ſhall be ſaved. All that the Father giveth unto Chriſt to redeem and ſave, ſhall come to him; and he that cometh unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt out. And if the humbled Sinner ſays, If I ſhould put my Truſt in Chriſt, the Arminian tells me, that I may be a Child of God to Day, and a Child of the Devil to Morrow: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould I, that know what a vile Heart I have, ever think of any Hope of Salvation? but ſink in utter Deſpair. Our Doctrine aſſures them, if the Lord be pleaſed once to unite them
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49367:64"/>to Chriſt by a true and lively Faith, the Lord will give them from time to time ſuch Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Supplies of his Spirit, as that they ſhall be kept in the ſtate of Grace, until they come to the ſtate of Glory. Therefore let all that are wiſe and ſpiritual judge which Doctrine gives grounds of moſt Encouragement, Support and Comfort, if the Lord pleaſe to ſet it home by his Spirit.</p>

            <p>THis Author, in his Epiſtle to his Book, falls upon the Aſſembly of Divines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's Decrees, and (according to the manner of the Man) leaves out that which ſhould clear their Senſe and Meaning, that ſo he might expoſe them.</p>
            <p>The Words in the Aſſembly's Confeſſion are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God from all Eternity did, by the moſt wiſe and holy Counſel of his own Will, freely and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ordain whatſoever comes to paſs; yet ſo as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neither is God the Author of Sin, nor is Violence offered to the Will of the Creatures, nor is the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Contingency of Second Cauſes taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</hi>

            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49367:64"/>
            <p>This Article is almoſt word for word the ſame with the Eleventh Article of the Epiſcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1615. long before the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> ſo that one would think it was taken thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God from all Eternity did, by his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable Counſel, ordain whatſoever in Time ſhould come to paſs; yet ſo, as thereby no Violence is offered to the Wills of the Reaſonable Creatures, neither the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor the Contingency of the Second Cauſes taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader may ſee what a Harmony there is about God's Decrees, between the old Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Divines, and the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been <hi>two ſorts of Atheiſts</hi> in the World; the firſt ſort of Atheiſts denied the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Being of God, the ſecond ſort of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts denied God's governing the World; the Lord keep this Age from being Atheiſts either of theſe ways.</p>
            <p>If the Evills of Afflictions that befall us came merely by Second Cauſes and Inſtruments, and were not determined and decreed by God, how ſhould we ſanctifie God's Name, and humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of God? As <hi>Job</hi> did, when he ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away: Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Men drive at in this <hi>Atheiſtical Age,</hi> to throw down the Soveraignty, Independency and Immutability of God, to make him change in his Purpoſes and Intentions, as Men do; and to make Contingencies to God, as there is to Man.</p>

            <p>It is come to this <hi>daring Boldneſs,</hi> that Men have aſſerted in Print, that God hath not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Period of Men's Lives, nor other things of that nature: But who, I pray, ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſhall come to paſs, but that bleſſed God who hath <hi>made àll things for himſelf,</hi> for his own Glory, for the Glory of his Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice and Mercy?

            <p>Ay, but the great Objection that blinds the Ignorant is, That if God have from Eternity decreed all things that come to paſs, then he hath decreed that Men ſhall fall into thoſe Sins that they do fall into.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> And what then? Do not we ſay that yet <hi>God is not the Author or Approver of Sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any Violence offered to the Will of the Creatures? Men ſin as freely as if there were no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God to leave them to commit thoſe Sins.</hi> We ſay that <hi>God's Decrees are not the Cauſe of Sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God the Author of Sin. Nihil iſto contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius, aut impoſſibilius, nempe Deum eſſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem peccati: Nothing is more contradictory or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible than this Propoſition, that God is the Author of Sin,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Twiſſe:</hi> Yet he is one that this Author puts in his Black Bill.</p>
            <p>Well, but this Author ſcrapes together ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſages quoted by Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> and other Writers, out of <hi>Calvin, Luther, Zuinglius, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and others; which are very ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's determining Men's Sins. What do you ſay to theſe Expreſſions?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: 1. That Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> and this Author might have ſpent their Time <hi>better,</hi> than to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with <hi>Calvin, Luther,</hi> and thoſe eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49367:65"/>in the Reformation. This is very pleaſing to the Papiſts, and thoſe that are Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected; for they hate the Names of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and thoſe Divines that God made uſe of, to communicate ſo much Light to the World. And if this Author knows it not, I will now tell him, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> long ſince, in his Writings, doth inveigh againſt them upon this very Account, concerning God's Decrees and Over-ruling Hand about the Sins of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay, <hi>I ſhall not meddle with any of his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> One may cut out Snips out of Authors, whereby the true Senſe and Meaning of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors may be quite altered.</p>

            <p>But of all the Reformed Divines, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhews moſt Wrath and Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Time was a glorious Light in the Church. <hi>Mr.</hi> Richard Hooker, <hi>that wrote againſt him about Church-Diſcipline, yet confeſſeth him to be the wiſeſt Man that ever the Church of</hi> France <hi>bred.</hi> And <hi>another Epiſcopal Divine</hi> ſaith, <hi>He never heard any good Man ſpeak of him without Honour.</hi> But this Author makes ſcurrilous Verſes of him, and directs them too to <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, though he hath been ſo long dead; and compares <hi>Calvin</hi> to <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Servetus</hi> to <hi>Abel.</hi> Let us enquire what this <hi>Servetus</hi> was. This Author is much miſtaken, to think that he was put to death for being of this Author's Judgment about Baptiſm; <hi>it was for Blaſphemy againſt the Bleſſed and Holy Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>this Author</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was a learned and worthy Man, though perhaps miſtaken in ſome things,</hi> pag. 27. <hi>Ah, Do you put a Perhaps</hi> he was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in ſome things, <hi>when he denied and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the Holy Trinity?</hi> Waving what <hi>Sleidan, Roſs,</hi> and others ſay of him, let us hear what

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Servetus</hi> ſtuffed all his Diſcourſes with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Blaſphemies. <hi>Beza</hi> tells us, he called the Trinity, <hi>Tricipitem Cerberum,</hi> (Words not fit to be Engliſhed, they are ſo full of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;) and wrote, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ridiculous Impoſtor, <hi>Beza, Epiſt.</hi> 1. And there are Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages cited out of his Book of the Trinity, (which I have not ſeen,) that ſeem to have as much of the Devil in them, as ever yet was written or ſpoken by any of the Sons of Men.

            </p>
            <p>Although this Author thinks that God doth not, for the Manifeſtation of his own Glory, over-rule the Children of Men, yet it is mamni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that God hath given him a Spirit of Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as a Check and Puniſhment to him, that he ſhould be left of God to deſame ſuch a Man as <hi>Calvin,</hi> and extol <hi>Servetus,</hi> an Antitrinitarian, and one of the greateſt Blaſphemers of the for

            <p n="1">1. VVHen <hi>Arminians</hi> have made great flouriſhes of Gods having the ſame love of good will to all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, they are exceedingly grated with this Objection that follows.</p>
            <p>If God have the ſame love of good will to all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> why are but ſome ſaved, and not all, why doth not God convert all?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of them are ready to ſay, <hi>that God cannot</hi> Convert them, they are ſo ſtubborn and rebellious, though he deſires to do it; but <hi>this is down-right Blaſphemy,</hi> to ſay that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convert thoſe whom he purpoſeth, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and deſireth to Convert, he that made the Heart, can change the Heart, <hi>can turn it as the Rivers of Water, which way ſoever he pleaſeth,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49367:68"/>with the greateſt facility, eaſilier then we can ſtir a finger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I heard above forty years ſince, an <hi>Arminian</hi> Preach, Mr. <hi>H.D.</hi> a Man of as great Learning and Ability, as moſt of that way in <hi>England,</hi> this Man was inveighing againſt Election and ſpecial Grace, at laſt he came to anſwer an Objection to this purpoſe: <hi>You will ſay, Is not this a meer beating of the Air, a meer flouriſh of words, to tell you that God hath ſuch a Love to all</hi> Adams <hi>Poſterity, that he would have them all ſaved, and yet they are not ſaved, ſuppoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a Mother ſhould ſay, that ſhe had a great Love for her Child, and ſhe ſees this ſimple Child running into a fire, that would burn it to Death, and the Mother could prevent it, and pull the Child back, but ſhe ſuffers it to go on and Periſh, who will ſay that ſuch a Mother had ſuch a true and tender Love to the Child?</hi> So ſaid this Preacher, <hi>If God have ſuch great and tender Love to all</hi> Adams <hi>Poſterity, and ſees them through their folly, inadvertency and corruption of their Hearts, running into Hell-fire, and he could ſtop them, and ſave them, and doth not, where is his Love and Deſire to ſave them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I cannot remember the very words, yet it was to this purpoſe that he brought in an Objection, he urged it very ſtrongly, <hi>I think over-ruled by God, to confute himſelf,</hi> I wondred how he would anſwer the Objection, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was this, <hi>what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I ſay God cannot,</hi> that is, that God could not Convert them, and ſo left it: To ſuch Abſurdities and Blaſphemies doth Arminianiſm lead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others of them ſay, that God indeed can
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49367:69"/>change the Rebellious Will of Man, but they alledge two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſay it is Diſhonourable to God,</hi> to go any further for the Converſion of a Sinner, than to ſet before him Arguments, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Promiſes, and urge theſe Arguments by inward Convictions; but they ſay, it is not for the Honour of God to put forth ſuch irreſiſtible power, as ſhall infallibly change and turn the Heart to God.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that God hath promiſed to ſome, abſolutely promiſed to the Elect, that which Divines call <hi>the firſt Grace,</hi> Jer. 31. Heb. 8. <hi>I will put my fear in their Hearts, I will write my Law in their Hearts,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, a new Spirit I will put within you, and I will take away the Heart of Stone</hi> (that is, take away the ſtubbornneſs and rebellion of your Wills and Affections) <hi>and I will give you a Heart of Fleſh,</hi> that is, I will give you a penitent, ſoft, plyable Will towards me and my Precepts; this God of his infinite Grace, hath promiſed to his Elect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, not one Man or Woman in the World had ever been Converted and Saved; and <hi>dare any ſay, that 'tis Diſhonourable to God, to ſhew this Grace and Favour?</hi> Is it come to this, that where God hath a gracious Reſpect to a perſon, that though the perſon be ignorant, fooliſh and deſperate, that it ſhould be <hi>Diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Phyſician of Heaven, to cure the Man of his Spiritual Phrenſy, and bring him to a right mind?</hi> Surely this is ſo far from being Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God, that the Elect, and Ranſomed People ſhall Adore him, and praiſe him for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49367:69"/>ever, for this great, free and undeſerved Grace to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſay, it is Diſhonourable to the Will of Man, yea, impoſſible</hi> for the Will of Man to be forced, therefore they ſay, that all that God doth towards the Converſion of any, is by Moral ſwaſion, and urging Arguments to <hi>this great Queen, the Will of Man,</hi> but ſhe her ſelf muſt not be touched.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>if God did not touch, yea, by an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent ſweetneſs change and turn the Will of Man to himſelf, there had never been any one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in this World: God works upon the Will in Converſion, to make it of unwilling willing, and to make it as willing to turn to God, as ever it was unwilling, before God touched and changed the Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this Author ſaith, <hi>you preſent Chriſt not ſerious, becauſe he will not ſave Men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no,</hi> page 22. I ſay this is <hi>a very ignorant Speech,</hi> and ſhews the Author to be <hi>little acquainted with the Scripture, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his own Heart;</hi> for though Men when they hear of Hell and Damnation, would be ſaved from Miſery, yet there is not any one that would be ſaved in the way that God hath appointed, until God by <hi>his immediate Hand, do ſecretly touch and change his Will,</hi> i. e. that though all would be ſaved from Hell under the Notion of a State of Miſery, yet till God give ſpecial grace, a new Heart, put a new bent upon the Will and Affections, there is no Man would be ſaved in Gods way, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way; that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To be made ſo poor in Spirit, as to be taken
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49367:70"/>off from all ſtanding upon Terms with God,</hi> but <hi>acknowledge his Soveraignty, and his Righteouſneſs, that he might take Vengeance upon us for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To acknowledge that we have not the leaſt Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs, but to creep under the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be willing to part with Sins, that are as dear to corrupt Nature, as Right Hands, and Right Eyes, to be willing to take up the Croſs, and follow Chriſt, to be willing to walk in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances of the Lord, ſo far as he ſhall pleaſe to make known his mind to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay, it were well if in ſtead of this <hi>bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> about theſe things, that all of us did exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether we our ſelves have been ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought upon by the Spirit of God, as that we are willing to be ſaved in Gods way, in the Goſpel way.</p>
            <p>Alaſs, Men are of this Opinion, and the other, and like the Phariſees, are induſtrious to make Proſelytes to their Opinions, and yet know nothing of the new Birth, of the work of Grace upon their own Souls: Therefore let us all be much in ſelf Examination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what work of Faith in Chriſt, what work of Repentance for Sin, what love to God and to his people and ways, is begun in us by the Holy Spirit, that ſo we <hi>may not think our ſelves ſomething, when we are nothing, deceiving our own Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>THis Author hath ſomething about this point, <hi>page</hi> 19.</p>

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49367:72"/>
            <p>I anſwer, none ever doubted but <hi>Men may fall from the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> from <hi>the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith,</hi> and from an Hiſtorical Notional Faith, from common Grace, from common Enlightning.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrine maintained by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, and, as I have ſhewed, by the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, and by the Articles of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is, <hi>that none that are truly regenerated, that have ſaving juſtifying Faith,</hi> ſhall <hi>be ſo left to themſelves, as to fall totally and finally, but ſhall be preſerved unto the Heavenly Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Believers may be left to themſelves <hi>at times,</hi> as <hi>David, Hezekiah, Peter</hi> and others, that they may fall foully to the Diſhonour of God, and to the wounding of their own Souls; but God will graciouſly recover them again, Grace is in a ſwoun in them, but not dead.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the Saints perſeverance is grounded,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the free and Eternal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable love of God to the Elect.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall not enlarge upon theſe things, but let us attend upon what this Author ſaith upon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49367:72"/>this point: Truly though the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines had poſitively declared for the Doctrine of the Saints Perſeverance, yet <hi>according to the faculty of the Man to catch at ſomething,</hi> [he ſaith] nor need any Man ſay more concerning falling away, than they do, <hi>for as they deny not but there are Temporary Believers</hi> (and truly ſuch are all that fall away) <hi>ſo they plainly tell us, that the pureſt Churches in Heaven, are ſubject to mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Error, and ſome have ſo degenerated, as to become no Churches of Chriſt, but Synagogues of Satan.</hi> Now ſaith he, <hi>ſurely the pureſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es under Heaven, are true Believers,</hi> and <hi>if theſe may become Synagogues of Satan, it is too much to prove the point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly either this Author is more <hi>Ignorant</hi> than I took him to be, before I ſaw his Book, or elſe which is far worſe, <hi>hath not an honeſt Mind,</hi> but is reſolved to wreſt Mens words contrary to what he knows they intended, as we ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſaith, the Aſſembly deny not but there are Temporary Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, what Ignorance or worſe is this? When Divines ſpeak of <hi>Temporaries,</hi> or <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Believers,</hi> they call them ſo, to <hi>Diſtinguiſh them from true Believers,</hi> thoſe that have a true lively juſtifying Faith: I ſuppoſe the phraſe was taken up from the Parable of the four ſorts of grounds, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. Our Saviour there compares ſome Hearers of the Word, to the <hi>High-way-ſide,</hi> that <hi>the Word doth not affect them at all,</hi> a <hi>ſecond ſort to the Stony Ground,</hi> that <hi>hear the Word with Joy,</hi> but <hi>they have no Root of grace in them;</hi> Ay, and if ſuch do abide to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49367:73"/>their Lives end with no other but ſuch a kind of Faith as they have, they could not be ſaved, but they often, eſpecially if Perſecution come, loſe that Hiſtorical, Notional Faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enlightning they had; the Hearts of theſe were <hi>never made good ground,</hi> they were never ploughed up, and ſown with the Seed of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, to bring forth Fruit unto God. The Scope of our Saviour in that Parable, is, that ſome are affected with the Word, and <hi>after a ſort believe,</hi> and yet never have the Root of the Matter, a New Heart.</p>
            <p>To explain this further, <hi>John</hi> 2.23, 24. It is ſaid, <hi>many believed on him, when they ſaw the Miracles; but Jeſus would not commit himſelf to them, for he knew all Men, he knew what is in Man;</hi> the meaning is, that though they <hi>believed after a ſort,</hi> yet he would not commit himſelf to them, and truſt them as true Diſciples, and true Friends to him, for he knew all Men, he knew they were not ſound Believers, he knew they had not that precious Faith of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>And ſo it's ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8.13. That <hi>he believed and was Baptized,</hi> and yet <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, That <hi>his Heart was not right in the ſight of God, but was in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bonds of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men may be enlightened and convinced, and <hi>after a ſort, be Believers, and yet never be truly humbled for Sin, as Sin; never be taken off from all Confidence in their own Righteouſneſs, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Chriſt alone for Juſtification, never have that Faith that worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. Thoſe that fall away have but an Hiſtorical, Notional
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49367:73"/>Faith, ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls <hi>Faith without Works, a dead Faith;</hi> Saving, Juſtifying Faith, differs not only in <hi>degree</hi> but in its Kind and Nature, from this Faith that they have that falls away, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.19. They <hi>went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us, but they went out from us, that they might be made manifest, they were not all of us;</hi> that is, that thoſe who were Profeſſors and Believers after a ſort, they went out from us, they fell away <hi>becauſe they were not of us,</hi> they were not of the Elect and Ranſomed People, they <hi>were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of like precious Juſtifying Faith with us,</hi> for if they had been ſo, no doubt, (the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts <hi>a no doubt upon it)</hi> they would have continued with us, and never have fallen to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> again; but they went out from us, fell off from their Profeſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enlightning, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us; but he <hi>tells them that had true Juſtifying Faith, they have an anointing from the Holy one,</hi> v. 21. and v. 27. the <hi>anointing which ye have received abideth in you,</hi> v. 27. Every one, the leaſt as well as the ſtrongeſt that have juſtifying Faith, they have The Spirit of God dwelling in them, <hi>they have another manner of work of the Spirit upon them,</hi> than any that fall away; they are <hi>new Creatures,</hi> they are <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and this Anointing with the Spirit of Grace, and with the Graces of the Spirit abideth in them againſt all oppoſition from the remainders of Corruption, againſt all oppoſition from Men or Devils: The Lord, to humble them, and to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49367:74"/>ſhew them, that it is of his meer Grace in Chriſt, that they are ſaved, may leave them in part to themſelves at times, and they may be as a Tree cut down, but yet there is the Root of the Matter, <hi>the Root of Grace</hi> always in them, and through the ſcent of the Water of Life, thro' new Influences, Supplies, and quickenings of the Spirit, they ſhall put forth Buds and Bloſſoms of Grace again.</p>
            <p>God hath promiſed to every true Believer, that <hi>he will never leave him nor forſake him,</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> he will never leave him nor forſake him totally, or finally, and 'tis God's not leaving or forſaking them, that keeps them from not leaving or forſaking of him: Let it be well obſerved, that we all by our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> have forſaken God, the Fountain of Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; we have left God, and God hath left us, as to any help by a Covenant of Works, that Covenant was Mutable and Conditional; God would not leave and forſake Man upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Man did not leave and forſake him, as to exact and perfect Obedience; but <hi>Adam,</hi> and all of us in him, did preſently leave and forſake God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and ſo God hath left and forſaken all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, as to Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them upon the terms of the Covenant of Works. But Bleſſed be God for a Covenant of Grace, and Jeſus the Mediator, whom ever the Lord takes internally into this Covenant, he will never leave them nor forſake them, and hath himſelf undertkaen to keep them, that they ſhall never totally and finally leave nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4, 5. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.9.10. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.3.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Aſſembly ſay in their Confeſſion of Faith;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the purest Churches under Heaven are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Mixture and Error, and have been ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, as to become no Churches of Chriſt, but Synagogues of Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which this Author ſaith, ſurely the pureſt Churches are True Believers, and if theſe pureſt Churches may become Synagogues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, it is too much to prove the point.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That the Point in hand, is, whether one, whom the Lord hath endued with a lively Juſtifying Faith, ſhall not be actually and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly kept by the Grace and Power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now this Poſition of the Aſſembly doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt very well with that point of Doctrine which they maintained about the perſeverance of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly of Divines are not ſpeaking of the Inviſible, Myſtical Church, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably united to Chriſt, but of particular Churches and Congregations of thoſe that are Profeſſors of the Goſpel, and they ſay rightly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the pureſt of theſe Churches of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are ſubject to mixture; <hi>i. e.</hi> that there may be in the pureſt Churches, <hi>unſound Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> that never had a Saving Work of Grace wrought in their Hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the pureſt Churches are <hi>ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> as to leſſer Errors, the pureſt Churches in the World may be guilty before God: Chriſt may not only have a few things, <hi>but many things</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the beſt Churches, either for Errors in Doctrine or Worſhip, or failings in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49367:75"/>in Miniſters and People, <hi>who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Errors,</hi> all his Errors; the pureſt Churches had need to be very Humble, and not boaſt of their Purity, but pray continually, that God would pardon and reform what he ſees amiſs in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The pureſt Church may ſo degenerate, as to be no Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi> All that the Aſſembly of Divines here ſay, is very true, and no contradiction at all to themſelves in their maintaining the certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of particular Saints; for tho' the pureſt Church may ſo degenerate in time, as to be no true Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan; yet if there be any True Believers in a Church, they are kept, <hi>notwithſtanding the Apoſtacy of the Church</hi> whereof they were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; tho' the Church doth ſo degenerate, as to loſe their <hi>Church ſtate,</hi> yet if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſound Chriſtian in that Church, he ſhall hold his <hi>ſpiritual Eſtate and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt</hi> for all that. If Chriſt have a <hi>few names</hi> in a Church that degenerates, thoſe ſhall be ſafe, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the reſt, as to their Church Eſtate, and Eternal-ſtate, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>which have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed their Garments, and they ſhall walk with me in white;</hi> i. e. they ſhall walk with Chriſt in the white of Grace here, to their lives end, and in the white of Glory for ever: Tho' the Lord do remove the Candleſtick, the Church-Eſtate, and will not own a People any longer to be a True Church; yet if there be any ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians amongſt them, they ſhall never be caſt off: Therefore, how vainly doth this Author
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49367:75"/>ſay from this paſſage of the Aſſemblies Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, here is too much to prove the Point, when there is not the leaſt ſhadow of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing they ſay, to prove, that any True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may fall totally and finally: Tho' thoſe that were Profeſſors of the Goſpel, and were in Churches, may ſo degenerate, as to loſe their Church-eſtate; yet if there were any in thoſe Churches that were True Believers, <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt them:</hi> A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Church may <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the Sound Members, may proſecute them to Death, but can never ſeparate them from the Love of Chriſt. The truth is, when a Church doth ſo wofully degenerate, as to be accounted no longer a Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan, the Lord is pleaſed many times to ſtir up thoſe that are Sound Chriſtians amongſt them, that they are more Lively and Spiritual than ever they were, and love not their Lives unto the Death, in bearing witneſs to the Truth.</p>
            <p>Now let us hear this Author declare, what <hi>his Opinion is about the Saints Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saith he, <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. <hi>For my part, tho' I doubt not but there is a State attainable in this Life, from which, by the Grace of God, Chriſtians ſhall not fall, yet I hold it a vanity for any Man to affirm of himſelf, or of any other perſon in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that it is impoſſible for him to fall, I hold it far better for the beſt, as well as others, to take heed leſt they fall.</hi>

            <p>The word <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> may be taken <hi>largely,</hi> for thoſe that are Chriſtians by Profeſſion only; no doubt but they may fall from their Profeſſion; or the word <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may be taken <hi>ſtrictly, for thoſe who are Chriſtians inwardly in the Heart and in the Spirit, as well as outwardly by Profeſſion:</hi> Now this we maintain from the Scripture, as hath been declared before, <hi>that all ſuch have attained ſuch an Eſtate, by their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, by their Juſtification, Adoption and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that they ſhall never fall totally or finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Author muſt intend ſome <hi>new Notion</hi> (if he underſtand himſelf) which muſt be, that though every one that is Really and Spiritually in Chriſt, is not in ſuch an Eſtate, as that he ſhall certainly perſevere in Grace, yet he who hath attained an <hi>extraordinary</hi> degree of Grace, <hi>or to an abſolute Perfection,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Quakers</hi> talk of, may, by the Grace of God, keep his ſtanding. This is a wondrous dark Paſſage, and I ſhall leave the Author in his Clouds; but we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That none attain to an abſolute perfection in this life,</hi> Rom. 7. Gal. 5.17. Eccleſ. 7.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the ſtrongeſt Saints in the World cannot keep themſelves one day, but are upheld by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Influences and Supplies of the Spirit,</hi> Phil. 1.13. 1 John 5.5. 2 Cor. 3.5.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49367:76"/>that Chriſt will not break (nor ſuffer to be broken) the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoking Flax, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. that is, where there is but a little Special Grace, that can but ſmoke, though it cannot flame, Chriſt will keep it, that it ſhall never be quenched, but ſhall at laſt flame out in Love and Praiſe, and ſinging in Heaven to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>God keeps True Believers in a ſtate of Grace till they come to Glory, <hi>not becauſe they are ſtrong, but becauſe they are his Elect, becauſe they are redeemed by the Blood of his Son, and at their effectual Calling, adopted to be his Children,</hi> and ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If Children, then Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. The leaſt Babe in Chriſt is God's Child, as well as the Eldeſt, and ſtrongeſt Believer, and ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be an Heir of God, and joint Heir with Chriſt: For as many as believed, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. The ſame Day and Hour that a Soul truly receiveth Chriſt, the Lord doth <hi>actually adopt that Soul,</hi> though it be a ſecret thing to the Soul, yet it is as if God ſhould ſay, I did predeſtinate thee to the Adoption of my Child by Chriſt, and now I do adopt thee to be my Child, to be an Heir of Eternal Life; and ſuch ſhall certainly be preſerved to the Heavenly Kingdom, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5.

            <p n="2">2. This Author ſaith, <hi>I hold it a Vanity for any Man to ſay of himſelf, it is impoſſible for him to fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. <hi>It is a Vanity indeed, for any Man to ſay of himſelf, it is impoſſible for him to fall, taking it for falling into Sin at all, for there is no Man that liveth and ſinneth not;</hi> yea, it would be Vanity, Pride, and Preſumption for the beſt Saint on Earth, to ſay, it is impoſſible for him to fall into groſs Sins, ſeeing <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fell ſo foully, though they were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly recovered again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It would be great Vanity for the beſt Saint on Earth to ſay, in any the leaſt Confidence in his own Strength, that it is impoſſible for him to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way totally and finally;</hi> for indeed, if they were left to themſelves, <hi>it is impoſſible that they ſhould ſtand in a ſtate of Grace one day;</hi> if everlaſting Arms were not underneath them, if they were not kept by the Power of God; If Chriſt did not hold them faſt, it were impoſſible that any of the Saints ſhould ſtand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay, <hi>That it is no Vanity, but a Triumph of Faith and Thankfulneſs to the God of all Grace,</hi> for a True Chriſtian, when God ſheds abroad his Love in his Heart, by the Holy Spirit, to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate me from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> Was it Vanity in <hi>David</hi> to ſay, <hi>Surely Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life, and I ſhall dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever?</hi> Pſal. 23.6. and Pſal. 73.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel, and afterwards bring me to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Was it Vanity in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge will give unto me, and not to me only, but to all them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49367:77"/>that love his appearing?</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. I ſuppoſe this Author may be of the Judgment of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and other Papiſts, that none can have Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in this Life of their Eternal Salvation, except it be by extraordinary Revelation.</p>
            <p>Then, as to what he ſaith, <hi>That it is a Vanity to tell any other particular Perſon, that it is impoſſible for him to fall;</hi> I anſwer, that if he intends falling totally and finally, I ſuppoſe it is not ordinary to ſay to any particular perſon, it is impoſſible for you to fall away; and if one do ſay ſo to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, it is upon a Suppoſition, that the Perſon is ſavingly united to Chriſt, as if a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon under deſertion ſaith, I once had Hope, through Grace, but now God will be gracious no more; I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Sin and Satan, one may aſſure him, that if e're God hath begun the good Work of Special, Saving Grace, he will perform it to the Day of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.24.</p>
            <p>Ay, but ſaith this Author, <hi>It is far better for the beſt to take heed leſt they fall.</hi> I anſwer, It is very well conſiſtent with the Doctrine of the Saints Perſeverance, to take heed leſt they fall, and to work out their Salvation with an Holy Fear and Trembling, looking diligently, leſt they fail of the Grace of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They that have the fullest aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are to take heed lest they fall into Sin;</hi> becauſe Sin is Sin in a Believer as well as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man; yea, in ſome ſence it is more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in a Believer, than in another Man, and tho' there be no Condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt, ſo that God will not caſt his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49367:78"/>into Hell for their Sins, yet he may ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtize them upon Earth, both by Inward Terrors of Conſcience, and outward Afflictions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such Cautions, as, take heed lest you fall,</hi> and the like, are one means by which God keeps his People from falling; God's infallibly keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People doth not take them off from their Duty of Watching and Praying, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them to their Duty: But ſtill if the Lord did not hold every Believer with a ſtrong hand, notwithſtanding all their care and taking heed, they would fall; yea, and fall as low as Hell.</p>
            <p>For what the Author adds, <hi>That good Laws were not made against Traytors and Felons, to make Men Traytors and Felons, but to keep Men from being Traytors and Feions.</hi> I anſwer, God's Laws and Precepts were not made to make Men wicked, but to reſtrain Men from Sin; and that they do, ſo far as God is pleaſed to give Men either <hi>Common and Reſtraining Grace, or Special and Sanctifying Grace:</hi> But the aim of this Author, is to make his ignorant and unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader, think, that there are no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, but Laws and Precepts ſet forth to Men as their Duty, which is a groſs miſtake, and is ſuch a Vail upon this Author, that till it be taken away, he will never underſtand theſe things. God's Eternal Decrees and Purpoſes, are his Intentions, what he himſelf will do for the manifeſtation of his own Glory; God's Laws and Precepts are his Commandments to us as our Sovereign Lord; but of theſe things I ſpake before in my Vindication of Dr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49367:78"/>
            <p>Before I end this Chapter, I would make this Obſervation, which may be of uſe to his own Soul, if the Lord pleaſe to put in by his own Spirit; however, it may be of uſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and it is this, that this Author, though he talks of a general Love of God to all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, and of God's ſetting forth good Laws, yet he ſeems to have had ſuch a dark Education, that he is not acquainted with the free Covenant of Grace, and the free Promiſes of Grace, that are made to ſome Perſons. Some Scriptures declare what God requires of us in Precepts and Commands, and <hi>in other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures he doth freely and abſolutely promiſe to ſome, to all the Elect,</hi> to all the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael, that he will do it for them,</hi> of his Free Grace in Chriſt: And indeed, if the Lord had not freely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely promiſed to do theſe things for ſome, there had not, there could not have been any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſaved.</p>
            <p>The firſt Promiſe of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> doth virtually contain all other Promiſes ſet forth afterward. This Seed of the Woman is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who being God by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was to take upon him Humane Nature, of a Woman: It was declared that he ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head, give him <hi>a mortal Wound</hi> for all whoſe Surety and Mediator he was, that he ſhould <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> that he ſhould certainly and infallibly bring all the Elect to Glory, notwithſtanding all that the Devil had done to bring <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under the Curſe of the Law. The Words hold forth no leſs than a full, perfect and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49367:79"/>Reſcue, in due time, from the Devil and Sin; that all, whoſe Surety and Mediator Chriſt was, ſhall certainly be Partakers of.</p>
            <p>In one Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. it is ſaid, <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Fore-skin of your Heart:</hi> In another, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. it is promiſed to the Elect, <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine Heart.</hi> It is commanded in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Cast away from you all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and make you a new Heart:</hi> And it is promiſed to the Elect, that God will do this for them, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the Heart of Stone, and give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> Let it be conſidered how abſolutely God undertakes for his Elect, in the Covenant of Grace; <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>I will.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> Ver. 34 <hi>They ſhall all know me.</hi> There are <hi>Promiſes unto Grace,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to give Grace, to work Grace infallibly in the Elect:</hi> And if we do not partake of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promiſes, that the Lord will work Grace in our Hearts, againſt all Oppoſition, we cannot be ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi> Joh. 10.16. <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: Them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Chapter, I would have this Author, and all that ſhall read what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, take notice, that I ſhall not meddle with thoſe few Paſſages that he quotes out of other Writers, for ſome of his Opinions. Indeed, he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49367:79"/>ſeems as if he would put out another Book with Quotations taken out of Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the Ancients, for ſome of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; <hi>If this Author will trouble the World with more Books to no purpoſe, who can help it?</hi> He may do it with great eaſe, though it may be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the Books themſelves; but Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> and Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> will furniſh him with Quotations out of the Greek and Latin Fathers, to his hand. But I ſhall not, I ſay, meddle with any Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that nature, for theſe Reaſons: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That before <hi>Pelagius</hi> broached his Errours, the Fathers did not ſpeak ſo diſtinctly and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Points of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this way of deciding Controverſies is endleſs: As we ſee when our Proteſtant Divines took that way with the Papiſts, we took the meaning of certain Paſſages one way, and they another. A learned Epiſcopal Divine, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Divinity in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> long ſince ſaid very well: <hi>The Fathers, in ſome things, are for the Papists, againſt us; in ſome things they are for us, againſt the Papiſts; and in ſome things they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer both from the Papiſts and us.</hi> But becauſe this makes Controverſies endleſs, and caſts <hi>a Miſt</hi> before the Eyes of the Common People, a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man amongſt the Papiſts gives this Advice to thoſe that have to do with Proteſtants, <hi>Get them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>out of their Caſtle of the Scriptures, into the large Field of the Fathers:</hi> And then he made account they could do well enough with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>it is Scripture, one Scripture compared with another, that muſt decide Controverſies.</hi> As
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49367:80"/>one of the Ancients ſaid, <hi>I would hear, Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> It is not what learned and Godly Men ſay, but what the Scripture ſaith, being rightly underſtood, and one place thereof compared with another, that muſt decide Controverſies. And there are certain Rules agreeing with the whole ſcope of Holy Writ, that muſt be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; as that no Scripture muſt be interpreted ſo, as in the leaſt to reflect upon the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Immutability and Omnipotency of God: No Scripture muſt be ſo interpreted, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage and diſhonour that perfect and eternal Redemption that Chriſt, God-Man, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for us; as if he died in vain for any, for whoſe Sins he made his Soul an Offering: No Scripture muſt be ſo interpreted, as to puff up proud Man with a Conceit that he doth merit his Salvation, when others periſh by his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſs and Care for himſelf, in improving his Talent better than others; but that all our good Inclinations, every good Thought, and all holy Deſires, are freely given us of God: It is he that worketh in us to will, and to do; and that not for any Worthineſs and Towardlineſs in us, above others, but <hi>of his own good Pleaſure, of his free Mercy in Chriſt.</hi> It is by Grace we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wholly by Grace, from firſt to laſt: Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was of mere Grace, our Redemption was of mere Grace, our Converſion of mere Grace; all is from ſpecial, diſcriminating, diſtinguiſhing Grace: We have not the leaſt thing to glory in, as if we had made our ſelves to differ from thoſe that periſh; but we muſt wonder here, and to all Eternity in Heaven, that we ſhould find Grace in the ſight of the Lord.</p>

            <p>As for the Title of <hi>Independents,</hi> we own it not; we are <hi>Dependents upon God, his Word, and upon other Churches, for Help, and Brotherly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Counſel in the Lord:</hi> But we deſire to keep our ſelves independent upon this Author, or any other that ſhall pretend to have any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdiction over us; for we hold, that there are no Churches of Chriſt's Inſtitution, under the New Teſtament, but particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that thoſe particular Congregations have not power over one another, but ought to be helpful and aſſiſting one to another, as the Matter ſhall require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Independent is too high a Title for any Saints on Earth, or in Heaven; yea, it is too high a Title for the holy Angels; it is only fit for the Almighty and Everlaſting God:</hi> And I heartily wiſh that this Author <hi>would but acknowledge God to be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, Abſolute and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncontrollable,</hi> and then he would never write ſuch a Book as he hath.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider that none of us hold, that God pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth any but for Sin, and that all having Sinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, he might have ſpared none of the Children of Men, and his Throne have been guiltleſs from our Blood for ever.</hi> Rom. 3.19, 23. — 5.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſider that the exceeding Riches of God's Grace, is to be adored for ever, that God ſhould Predeſtinate any of the Children of Men, to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt, give him to Redeem them, and his Spirit to Sanctifie them,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 Pet 1.3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Conſider well, that it is one part of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature by the fall, to quarrel with the Great and Holy God, concerning his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> Gen. 3.12. <hi>Adam diſcovered this Temper,</hi> when once his Nature was Corrupted; <hi>The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me of the Tree,</hi> this was nothing but quarrelling with God; and <hi>Eve</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>the Serpent beguiled me, as if</hi> ſhe had ſaid, why didſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Devil to tempt me? Ah, <hi>let there be an Holy Trembling,</hi> and if the Lord do not for one, as for another, ſhould Men quarrel with the Lord: <hi>Luke</hi> 4.23. to 30. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told the People, that <hi>none could come to him, except it were given unto him of the Father,</hi> John 6.65. <hi>from that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walkt no more with him, V.</hi> 66. In ſtead of being humbled at their own Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Inability, to come to Chriſt, and looking to God to give them Faith by ſpecial Grace, they quarrel with this Doctrine of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49367:82"/>Effectual Grace of God, and fall off: We may conceive it to be the temper of the Damned in Hell, to quarrel with the Holy Soveraignty of God, as, why did God ſuffer the Devil to tempt our firſt Parents, which was the firſt inlet to all our Miſery, ſeeing he could have hindered it? Why did God make our firſt Parents mutable in their Eſtate of Holineſs and Happineſs, when as he fixt the Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in their Holineſs and Happineſs? Why did God ſuffer the Devil and falſe Teachers to draw us to Errours of Judgment, and Sins of Life, which encreaſe our Condemnation, when he knew how prone we were to Sin? Why did God chooſe the other Company in Heaven, and leave us to our ſelves? Why had he not the ſame Love for us? Why did he not give his Son to be an abſolute and compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us, and ſend his Spirit to turn us Effectually and Infallibly, as he could have done, and hath done for ſome as bad or worſe than we by practice, till the Lord turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? I ſay, we may conceive, that the Damned in Hell do thus quarrel with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of God in his Diſpenſations, which ſhould make us on Earth to have a care of all things that tend to a quarrelling with God's Diſpenſations, for it is the Spirit and Frame of the Devils and Damned in Hell: Therefore the way we are to take for our Salvation, is to lay to Heart the Soveraignty and Greatneſs and Holineſs of him with whom we have to do, to be ſenſible of the Heinouſneſs of Sin, and to acknowledge that God is Righteous, though he ſhould take Vengeance on us, to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49367:82"/>hearken to the Report of the Goſpel, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners and that he that believes on him, ſhall be ſa ved, and to pray and wait upon God to work upon our Hearts, by an Invincible overcoming Power of his Spirit, to believe that Jeſus is the Son of God, to rely on, and truſt in his Mediation and Righteouſneſs, and to give up our ſelves to be governed and ſanctified by him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Conſider that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Common ſufficient Grace to all Mankind, which Men cry up,</hi> though the Preachers of it may do it in the Simplicity of their Hearts, and think they advanced the Glory of God by it, yet, it is Satans deſign thereby to rob God of the Glory of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that ſhall inherit everlaſting Life, and to make them their own Saviors; for if, notwithſtanding what the Father did for any in Election, the Son in Redemption, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in working upon their Hearts, they might have periſht for ever, then the chief praiſe muſt be to themſelves, to their ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, towardlineſs and care for themſelves.</p>

            <p>After this, I Received an Anſwer to mine, wherein <hi>he doth not own that he was the Perſon intended in that Book I ſaw,</hi> ſo <hi>I deſire however, that the Reader of my Letter would wholly wave that part of the charge againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, in my firſt Letter to him, I did not directly Anſwer to his queries, but it ſeems I muſt do it, but I would be very brief in it, for I have ſpoken of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation already.</p>

            <p>It ſeems that in a Sermon which I Preacht twenty four years ſince, from this Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14. I had two paſſages that do not pleaſe this Author; it being ſo long time ſince, it was with Difficulty that I got the Sermon.</p>
            <p>The paſſage, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. opening that Scripture, the <hi>Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you:</hi> I ſhewed that the meaning of the Apoſtle, is amongſt other things, <q>That theſe Believers might always have the Sence and Comfort of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> in chooſing them before the Foundation of the World, to be Veſſels of Mercy; it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Oh! That you may always ſee the ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Love of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards you, that when he had ſo many Millions of Souls in his Eye, that he ſhould chooſe you to everlaſting Life, and paſs by ſo many that you ſhould be <hi>Jacobs,</hi> whom he hath loved, and not <hi>Eſaus,</hi> whom he hath hated; that he hath not appointed you to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Sence and Comfort and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this Unſpeakable Love of God be with you.</q> This is the firſt paſſage in that Sermon, that offended this Author.</p>
            <p>Now upon this, ſaith this Author, both ſorts being ſuppoſed to be living, when you wrote thus;</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Wherefore did the Lord paſs by the Millions? And after what manner did he hate them? Did he afford them no Means; that they might be ſaved?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Author ſaith, both ſorts being <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49367:84"/>to be living, when you wrote thus;</hi> How impertinent is this? Did I write, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14. did not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> write it to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Prayeth that the love of God may be with them (as I have opened it in ſome meaſure) no doubt there are of the Elect, and of thoſe that are paſſed by, now living on the Earth, both in the Sence that I hold Election, and in the Sence that he holds Election; but that which I ſaid was to open the meaning of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Benediction or Prayer for the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> not mentioning the perſons to whom I ſpake, whether they were Elected, or not Elected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But for the Query, <hi>wherefore did the Lord paſs by the Millions, and after what manner did he hate them? did he afford no means, that they might be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Love of God (in the Text I opened) which to be ſure, muſt be underſtood of the ſpecial Love of God, it ſeems that, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> is not now alive for you to quarrel with, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt ſend Queries to me about God's Eſpecial Love, and wherefore God had not the ſame Love for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, and you muſt know of me, how God hated thoſe whom he did not chooſe to Salvation? It is ſufficient to tell you, that he did not Love them to Elect them to Salvation, to Grace and Glory, but Decreed to leave them to their Sins, and to glorifie his Juſtice upon them for their Sins; and who are you that ſhall ſay unto God, What doſt thou? muſt God give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? He ſaith, I will be gracious, to whom
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49367:85"/>I will be gracious; He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardens.</p>
            <p>Yea, but you ſay, <hi>did he afford no means whereby they might be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. The fallen Angels that were far more glorious Creatures, than the Children of Men never had any means that they might be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the Children of Men, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind never had ſo much as the Outward means of Salvation, and none but the Elect, have inward, ſufficient Means of Salvation;</hi> there is nothing ſhort of God's giving actually a new Heart, and infuſing Grace, ſo as to make dead Souls live, is ſufficient to Unite the Soul to Chriſt; indeed the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold, and they grow upon the Root of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> that all Men have a ſufficient Light within, to bring them to Salvation, if they would but heed it; but if the Light in us be Darkneſs, how great is that Darkneſs?</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>What are the People, to whom you write, better than other Men, and why do you call them</hi> Jacobs?</p>
            <p>I pray, who did I write to? I only open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and if you ask what were they better than other Men? The Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11, 12. they to whom he wrote, had been ſome of them <hi>much worſe than many other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men,</hi> but through the Exceeding Riches of God's grace in Chriſt, <hi>they were waſhed, they were Juſtified, they were Sanctified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49367:85"/>God;</hi> And this was a Fruit and Effect of Gods free and eternal Love to them.</p>
            <p>This Author adds, Or did you mean it of the Dead? Truly all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are dead, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote concerning this ſpecial Love of God; but no doubt there are many now living, that are partakers of the ſame grace; and as to thoſe that are not Elected, I ſuppoſe you do not queſtion but there are Millions, who are ſo paſſed by, as that they are now in the Priſon of Hell.</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>You take your ſelf for a</hi> Jacob, <hi>and me for an</hi> Eſau <hi>(as I ſuppoſe.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Truly Sir, I am ſorry you ſhould thus diſgrace your ſelf; If you had not written your Name to the Queries you ſent me, I ſhould have thought they had been ſent me by ſome <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Woman, rather than by a Man.</hi> Why do you ſay, that you ſuppoſe, I take you for an <hi>Eſau?</hi> You may be Elected to Salvation for any thing I know; Our Doctrine doth not allow us to ſay of any particular Man yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God hath appointed him to Wrath, except we had grounds to think that he hath committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is a ſin that is very rarely committed, and I never knew that perſon in my whole Life, that I was ſo uncharitable to, as to think that perſon had Committed that ſin.</p>
            <p>But <hi>you ſay, that you are mine Ancient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>now a Stranger in this City, and I never had the Humanity to invite you to my Houſe; had a Neighbor's Dog come to you out of</hi> Lincoln-ſhire, <hi>would you not have been more kind to him, than you have been to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:49367:86"/>
            <p>I anſwer, That thoſe that do not know things may think that you and I have been great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and that we lived very near together, either in the ſame Town, or within a few miles one of another: Sir, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect your ſelf, <hi>I cannot remember that ever I ſaw your face more than three times in my Life, before I ſaw you lately in</hi> Norwich. The firſt time I ſaw you, was upon the Road on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, I met a Friend upon the High-way, that you were travelling with, I ſaluted him, and he told me your name, and ſo after a few words, you went your way, and I mine. The ſecond time was about <hi>fifteen years ſince,</hi> going to ſee a Neighbour that lay Bed-rid (he was one of your way, but I think a Godly Man, and I viſited him ſeveral times in Love) you was there, and we had two Hours Diſcourſe, and all about Controverſies. The third time was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight <hi>Years ſince</hi> you came into a Friends Houſe, where I was upon a Journey, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about an hour. This was all our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and as for our being Neighbours, it is true, that <hi>in ſome ſence, all are our Neighbors:</hi> but I ſuppoſe you and I liv'd <hi>twenty Miles Diſtant,</hi> though I am not certain where you lived, for as you never were at mine Houſe in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> ſo I never was at yours. <hi>What a poor buſineſs is it, that the World ſhould be troubled about our Acquaintance and Neighbourhood?</hi> Sir, though you and I differ in ſeveral points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet I love all Men, and though I do not deſire intimacy with any Man, that is of a Contentious Spirit (I love Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) yet if you pleaſe to let me know when
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49367:86"/>you are in any want, you ſhall find that not only my ſelf will relieve you; but that I ſhall get others of my Friends to Miniſter unto you, otherwiſe I do not deſire Acquaintance with you, whilſt you are ſo violent and abuſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then you ſay, that ſome of my</hi> Jacobs <hi>have called you Rogue, and wiſht that you were put out of the Town:</hi> I am ſorry that you ſhould uſe ſuch <hi>paſſionate Speeches, as to call any perſons my</hi> Jacobs; and as to calling you Rogue, I hope none of the Congregation that I belong to, ever uſed ſuch unſeemly words of you, for my part, I have always ſpoke of you in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with good Reſpect, till you put forth the Book: I love to ſpeak the beſt I can of every Man.</p>
            <p>Q. 4. You tell me, that in pag. 19. <hi>God choſe us, ſo many, and no more; I pray, who are thoſe us whom you call us, ſurely you ſpeak of the Living?</hi> I anſwer, Let the Reader hear with Patience what is ſaid <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. the words are theſe, <q>
                  <hi>This is eſpecially applied to the Father in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to chooſe us before the Foundation of the World, to foreknow us, to predeſtinate us to be conformable to the Image of his Son;</hi> therefore in that Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. where you have the proper and diſtinct Work of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt about the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Mercy, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> obſerve here, <hi>our Election is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God the Father, he choſe us, ſo many and no more, this Man and not the other,</hi> Jacob <hi>and not</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:49367:87"/>Eſau; then you have the proper work of the Son in thoſe words, <hi>the ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, it is he who waſheth us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> he purchaſeth all good things, the ſecond Perſon in the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He is the Lord our Righteouſneſs, he is the Propitiation for our Sins, he is our Mediator;</hi> it is not the Father that is Mediator, nor the Holy Ghoſt, but the Son; it is he that took upon him our Nature, <hi>it was the Word that was made Fleſh;</hi> not the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>it was the Son that died upon the Croſs for our Sins,</hi> not the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt; then you have the ſpecial Work of the Holy Ghoſt about our Sanctification, in theſe words, <hi>through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience:</hi> It is the Holy Ghoſt, who in our Converſion doth Sanctifie us, and bring us to the Obedience of Faith; he applieth Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Son hath wrought Redemption; when the appointed time, when the fulneſs of time is come to call home an Elect Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he convinceth the Soul of Sin, he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt to the Soul, he infuſeth the Habit of Grace, and after Converſion, is with us, to mortifie our Corruptions, comfort us, and lead us and to carry us to the Heavenly Kingdom.</q>

            <p>Now, What Cauſe had this Author to ſay, <hi>Who are theſe, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s? Surely, you ſpeak of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>

            <p>Qu. 5. and 6. <hi>Are both about the ſame thing, about</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau? <hi>Now, concerning</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau, <hi>note,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Eſau</hi> was not ſaved appears by <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Leſt there be any Fornicator, or profane Perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one Morſel of Meat, ſold his Birth-right.</hi> This Obſervation may give much Light into this Matter, that when any that were <hi>real Saints under the Old Teſtament</hi> are ſpoken of in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> all their ſinful Failings are covered, and their Grace only mentioned: So it is with <hi>Abraham, Sarah, Job, Sampſon, Lot;</hi> though they had many ſinful Failings, yet (I ſay) they are covered in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and their Faith, Patience and Holineſs only mentioned. Or if there be an hint of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Failings, as of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> there is mention alſo <hi>of their Faith and Prayer, and the Grace of God beſtowed upon them.</hi> But when <hi>Eſau</hi> comes to be mentioned in the New Teſtament, the Holy Ghoſt leaves him upon Record, <hi>that he was a profane Perſon,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

Let Men cavil what they pleaſe, God will be God, and do whatever he will.</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſome may ſay, How doth <hi>Paul</hi> make out this from what was ſpoken to <hi>Rebekah, The Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, The Apoſtle knew by the Spirit of God, that there was a Myſtery in theſe Words; not only that two Nations were to come out of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> but that which was <hi>primarily
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49367:89"/>intended</hi> was, that the Perſon of <hi>Jacob</hi> was lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and choſen to Eternal Life, and not <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, but how came the Apoſtle to mention what is written in</hi> Malachy, <hi>concerning</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau's <hi>Poſterity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, The Apoſtle brings what is written there, by way of Accommodation and Alluſion, thus: That as God made a great Difference as to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s and <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Poſterities, <hi>ſo much more as to</hi> Jacob<hi>'s and</hi> Eſau<hi>'s Perſons.</hi> Some of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity were afflicted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at other times, as well as <hi>Eſau</hi>'s; and <hi>Jacob</hi> perſonally did never get Dominion over <hi>Eſau,</hi> as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things, but the Apoſtle ſheweth that the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> was from Eternity elected of God, and not <hi>Eſau.</hi> If we cannot ſee how the Apoſtle could collect this from that place in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and that in <hi>Malachy,</hi> yet, I pray, let us reverence and believe the Scriptures, and not quarrel with the Pen-men, who were infallibly inſpired. I have heard indeed of an Arminian Preacher, that wiſhed that <hi>Paul</hi> had never writ any thing, and eſpecially not <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter will confute all the Arminians in the World.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of God's Eternal Decree and Purpoſe concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> doth evidently appear by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: <hi>Is there <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs with God?</hi> That is, in not purpoſing to beſtow his Grace upon ſome, <hi>Job</hi> 36.3. but paſſing them by, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>God forbid:</hi> Surely, we ſhould aſcribe Righteouſneſs to our Maker, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14.

            <p>God is from Everlaſting, he was infinitely happy in himſelf; that he made Angels and Men was merely from the pleaſure of his Will: He could have made all the Angels, and all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> Eternal and Immutable Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Honour, if ſo it had pleaſed him. But what if God, the great and glorious God, who is to be adored and feared of all; What if God pleaſed to make Angels and Men, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his own Glory, one way or other? Who ſhall ſay unto him, Why did God make Angels and Men at all, of whom, ſo many ſhall be ſo miſerable, that it had been good for them that they had never had a Being? But what if the great and glorious God, willing to ſhew his Wrath and holy Juſtice, and to make his Power known, did decree to leave ſome to themſelves, and to their Sins, and to glorifie his Juſtice upon them? Yea, but may ſome ſay, As to the Children of Men, they were all left to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and are alike by Nature: But what if God have afore prepared ſome to Glory by his Eternal Election, and redeems them by the Blood of his Son, and calls them in due time by his Grace and Spirit, as thoſe whom he hath
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49367:91"/>choſen to be Veſſels of Mercy, who ſhall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion God for what he doth? They that periſh, periſh for Sin; the Throne of the Holy God is guiltleſs for ever: They that are ſaved, are ſaved by the exceeding Riches of his Grace and Kindneſs towards them, through Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>Thus I have anſwered the Author's Six Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he ſent me in a Letter: Now I come to his Seventh and laſt Query.</p>
            <p>Qu. 7. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I preach God's Love to Mankind to be ſuch, that he gave his Son to be the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, this you call Arminianiſm, the Life and Soul of Popery?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is utterly falſe,</hi> that ever I ſaid ſo: Let him look upon my Letter, and ſee how he hath wronged me in print. I wrote to him in my ſecond Letter, that Arminianiſm was the Root of Quakeriſm; and that a good Divine ſaith, that it is the Life and Soul of Popery. But as for God's giving his Son to be a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, <hi>it is a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. And the meaning of that Phraſe, as I have made it evident, when I opened that Text in this preſent Book, is only this; <hi>That Chriſt died for the Elect, not only for the</hi> Jews, <hi>but alſo for the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>throughout the whole World.</hi> But I maintain, that Arminians deny that God gave his Son to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a true Scripture-Senſe, for the Sins of any one Man or Woman in the World: Whilſt they pretend to hold Univerſal Redemption, they hold not Redemption at all; but do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that, notwithſtanding any Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49367:91"/>Chriſt made, there might not one Man or Woman in the World ever have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>I ſaid in that Letter, (though he did not think fit to mention it,) that <hi>Arminianiſm was the Root of Quakeriſm;</hi> which I ſhall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate thus: Arminians hold that Men have ſufficient Grace to bring them to Salvation, if they improve their Talent; that is, Nature, and what Helps they have, as they ſhould do: Hence the firſt Quakers, being Arminians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this into other Words, but <hi>the ſame for ſubſtance;</hi> That there is a ſufficient Light in all Men, that if they do but heed, it will bring them to Salvation: And ſo Arminianiſm is the Fundamental Point of that Sect.</p>
            <p>I ſaid alſo in my ſecond Letter, <hi>that a good Divine</hi> (I did not name him, but it was Mr. <hi>L.) ſaid, that Arminianiſm is the Life and Soul of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi> Upon which, he ſaith, <hi>Sure, you do not know what Popery is!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will maintain what this Divine ſaid, thus: Though the Papiſts hold many other Errours, yet the Life and Soul of Popery is, <hi>their Doctrine of Man's Merits, either by way of Condignity, or Congruity; the Generality of them being ignorant of Chriſt's being an abſolute Propitiation and Purgation for Sin, by his Death: They look to be reconciled and purged by their own Merits, and thinking that Faith alone in that Propitiation and Purgation by the Blood of Chriſt, is not ſufficient to juſtifie them that come unto God by him, therefore they truſt to the Merit of their own Works; and thinking that ſuch good Works as are appointed in the Word are not ſufficiently meritorious, they have invented many
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49367:92"/>ſuperſtitions Obſervations; and then, leſt all ſhould fail, they count upon a Purgatory after this Life, where they ſhall be purified from their Sins, by their ſuffering the Pains thereof.</hi> So that Arminianiſm, which makes the Dving of Chriſt for a Perſon, ſuch a low, inſignificant thing, makes them look out for better Helps, as they think, than from Chriſt the only Mediator: And I ſuppoſe that upon ſuch grounds that Divine called Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm the Life and Soul of Popery.</p>
            <p>As for what he adds <hi>Whether your conceit, that God hated ſo many millions before there was any cauſe of hatred in them; yea, before they had a Being; yea, before the World was; yea, from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, be not the life and Soul of</hi> Calviniſm? I anſwer, God from Eternity had all in his Eye, knew them as really as if they had then had a Being, and loved and choſe to Salvation through Chriſt, whom he pleaſed; and for the reſt, let it be obſerved, that <hi>God is not ſaid properly to hate any</hi> (no not the Devils and damned in Hell) all that we ſay is, that he never purpoſed to beſtow that Grace upon them that periſh, which of his good Pleaſure, he purpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon others, but to leave them to their Sins, and to Condemnation for their Sins: And whereas he ſpeaks of the Life and Soul of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm,</hi> as I had done of the Life and Soul of <hi>Popery, it ſhould ſeem as if he made</hi> Calviniſm <hi>as ill as Popery (yea, it may be he thinks it much worſe)</hi> It puts me in mind of what I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard, that ſome of this Author's Judgment ſhould ſay, That truly, if they were to change, they would turn Papiſts rather than to any other Perſwaſion in the Land. I ſpeak this by the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49367:92"/>way; not that I charge this Author with any thing more than he will freely own himſelf.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew what Promoters the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are of <hi>Anminianiſm,</hi> I would have two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and taken notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Letter dated, <hi>March</hi> 1628 from a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit to the Rector of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> wherein there are theſe words, <hi>Whilst King</hi> James <hi>lived (you know) he was very violent against</hi> Arminianiſm, <hi>and interrupted (with his peſtilent Wit, and deep Learning) our Deſigns;— Now we have planted that Sovereign Drug,</hi> Arminianiſm, <hi>which we hope will purge the Proteſtants from their Hereſie, and it flouriſheth and will bear Fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi> This Letter was long ſince Printed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Year 1653, Pope <hi>Innocent the Tenth,</hi> by a ſolemn Bull, or Papal Conſiſtorial Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in the Caſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ypres, declared for the</hi> Pelagian <hi>Tenets:</hi> Now the <hi>Arminians</hi> follow the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> I have ſet down theſe things, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may take notice, that <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> are more ſuited to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> than to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion. It came into my Mind, upon this Author's talking of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> to ſet down theſe two Paſſages, which, it may be, few have been acquainted with.</p>
            <p>Now I have done with this Author, and do appeal to any Sober, Judicious Perſon. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Author hath in his Queries dealt <hi>like a modeſt man; yea, like a fair, honeſt, moral man?</hi> He hath put me to a great deal of pains to Anſwer his Book, conſidering my Age, and what bad Eyes I have had ſome years, whereby both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eading and Writing are made hard to me.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49367:93"/>If he write again, I do not intend to meddle with him any more; I know in ſome meaſure all the Sophiſtry, Cavils, and Evaſions of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and whatſoever he can write, will be but a meer ſhew and ſhadow of an Anſwer, a quarrelling at ſome by-expreſſions, I know that what I have written already, will ſtand as an Anſwer to all that he can write here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I bow my Head, and worſhip the Father of Lights, who hath ſo far enabled me to clear up theſe Points, that I hope the Faithful ſhall underſtand them, and be rooted and grounded in the Truth. All the Weakneſs and Imperfection in handling theſe things, is mine; all that is good to the uſe of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Church in my Labours, is from God, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
